[ Man Narrating ] When you love someone,
you've gotta trust them.

There's no other way.

You've got to give them the key
to everything that's yours.

Otherwise, what's the point?

And, for a while, I believed
that's the kind of love I had.

♪♪ [ Choir Singing ]

Before I ever ran a casino
or got myself blown up,

Ace Rothstein was
a hell of a handicapper,
I can tell you that.

I was so good that whenever I bet,
I could change the odds

for every bookmaker in the country.

I'm serious. I had it down so cold

that I was given paradise on earth.

I was given one of the biggest
casinos in Las Vegas to run,
the Tangiers,

by the only kind of guys
that can actually get you
that kind of money,

$62,700,000.

I don't know all the details.

[ Man #2 Narrating ] Matter of fact,
nobody knew all the details,
but it should've been perfect.

I mean, he had me,
Nicky Santoro, his best friend,
watching his ( … ),

and he had Ginger, the woman he loved,
on his arm.

But in the end, we ( … )ed it all up.

It should've been so sweet too.

But it turned out to be the last time
that street guys like us

were ever given anything
that ( … )in' valuable again.

[ Ace ] At that time, Vegas was a place
where millions of suckers

flew in every year on their own nickel

and left behind about a billion dollars.

But at night, you couldn't see the desert
that surrounds Las Vegas.

But it's in the desert where lots of
the town's problems are solved.

[ Nicky ] Got a lot of holes in the desert,

and a lot of problems
are buried in those holes.

Except you gotta do it right.

I mean, you gotta have
the hole already dug

before you show up
with a package in the trunk.

Otherwise, you're talking
about a half hour or
45 minutes of diggin'.

And who knows who's gonna
be comin' along in that time?

Before you know it,
you gotta dig a few more holes.

You could be there all ( … )in' night.

[ Horn Honking ]

♪♪ [ Scatting Continues ]

[ Ace ] Who could resist?
Anywhere else in the country
I was a bookie, a gambler,

always lookin' over my shoulder,
hassled by cops, day and night.

But here, I'm Mr. Rothstein.

I'm not only legitimate,
but running a casino.

And that's like selling people
dreams for cash.

I hired an old casino pal,
Billy Sherbert, as my manager,
and I went to work.

For guys like me, Las Vegas
washes away your sins.

It's like a morality car wash.

It does for us what Lourdes
does for humpbacks and cripples.

And along with making us legit

comes cash, tons of it.

What do you think we're doing out here
in the middle of the desert?

It's all this money.

This is the end result
of all the bright lights

and the comp trips, of all the champagne

and free hotel suites
and all the broads and all the booze.

It's all been arranged
just for us to get your money.

That's the truth about Las Vegas.

We're the only winners.

The players don't stand a chance.

And their cash flows from the tables

to our boxes through the cage

and into the most sacred room
in the casino.

The place where they add up
all the money--

the holy of holies, the count room.

Now, this place was off-limits.

Even I couldn't get inside.

But it was my job
to keep it filled with cash.
That's for sure.

[ Nicky ] They had so much
( … )in' money in there,

you could build a house out of stacks
of hundred-dollar bills.

And the best part was that upstairs,

the board of directors didn't
know what the ( … ) was going on.

I mean, to them everything
looked on the up and up.

Right? Wrong.

The guys inside the counting room

were all slipped in there
to skim the joint dry.

They'd do short counts, they'd lose fill slips.

They'd even take cash
right out of the drop boxes.

And it was up to this guy right here,

standin' in front of about two million dollars,

to skim the cash off the top
without anybody gettin' wise,

the IRS or anybody.

Now, notice how in the count room nobody
ever seems to see anything.

Somehow, somebody's always
lookin' the other way.

Now, look at these guys.
They look busy, right?

They're countin' money.
Who wants to bother them?

I mean, God forbid they should
make a mistake and forget to steal.

Meanwhile, you're in and you're out.

Past the jag-off guard who
gets an extra C-note a week
just to watch the door.

I mean, it's routine. Business as usual:
In, out, hello, good-bye.

And that's all there is to it.

Just another fat ( … )
walkin' out of the casino
with a suitcase.

Now, that suitcase was goin'
straight to one place:

right to Kansas City,
which was as close to Las Vegas as
the Midwest bosses could go

without gettin' themselves arrested.

That suitcase was all
the bosses ever wanted,

and they wanted it every month.

Now, this old Mormon ( … ) here,

he had to fly in with suitcases
once a month, nice and easy.

The bosses would come
from all over the place--

Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee,

all over the Midwest.

And they would meet in the back
of this produce market in Kansas City.

I mean, nobody even knew it.

One of the guys made
his mother do all the cookin'.

Now, these old greaseballs
might not look it,

but believe me, these are the guys
who secretly control Las Vegas,

because they control the Teamsters Union.

And that's where you had to go
if you wanted to borrow money
to buy a casino.

Nobody got a Teamsters' loan
unless the guys in this room

knew they were gonna get
their little suitcases.

Guys like this antique
over here, out of Detroit.

Or especially guys like Remo Gaggi,
the outfit's top boss.

Definitely the most
important guy in this room.

[ Man ] I know it's a little early
for Las Vegas...

[ Laughter ]

but I do want to welcome
the ladies and gentlemen
of the gaming industry.

[ Ace ] As far as the world
was concerned,

Andy Stone, the head of
the Teamsters' Pension Fund,

was a legitimate guy. A powerful man.

He even played golf with the president.

But Andy also took orders.

And when he was told
to give a pension fund loan
to Philip Green...

he did what he was told.

[ Nicky ] Now, here was
the perfect front man.

I mean, what the ( … ) else could he be?
He didn't know too much.

He didn't want to know too much,

especially that the bosses
made the Teamsters lend him the money.

He wanted to believe the Teamsters

gave him all that ( … )in' money
'cause he was smart.

And where they got Green from,
who the ( … ) knows?

All I know is that Green was
an Arizona real estate hustler

who barely had enough gas money

to come and pick up his own check.

And of course it was the bosses' man,

Andy Stone, who gave all the orders.

Not the chairman of the board, Philip ( … ) Green.

Now all they needed was
somebody they could trust
to run the casino.

And who better than Ace?
I mean, he was already in Vegas a couple years,
and he had the place clocked.

But typical Ace, give him a shot
at runnin' a casino,

and he tries to talk you out of it.

I don't know if I could do this
even if I wanted to.

The Gaming Commission
would never give me a license.

I have at least two dozen
gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.

You don't have to have a license
to work in a casino.

All you gotta do is apply for one.

The state law says that
you can work in a casino

while they're processing your application.

They got a 10-year backlog.

- What happens when they do find out?
- Why would they want to find out?

We're puttin' a hundred million
into this desert here. Why would
they want to lock us out?

Besides, they'll never find out.
All you gotta do is keep
changing your job title.

Like, uh, from Casino Executive
to Food and Beverage Chairman.

What happens is they take your application,
they put it at the bottom of the pile.

I know guys been workin'
there for 30 years don't have a license.

It's a tough proposition, Andy.

You know if I did it,
I'd have to run it my way.

- You got it.
- I'm serious, no interference.

Nobody's gonna interfere with
your running the casino.

I guarantee it.

[ Nicky ] And that's how they got
Ace to take over.

They wanted him because Ace ate, slept,
and breathed gambling.

They worked out
a real cute job title too--

Tangiers Public Relations Director.

But the only thing he ever
directed was the casino.

He made his first bet
when he was 15 years old,
and he always made money.

But he didn't bet like you or me.

You know, havin' some fun
with it, ( … ) like that.

He bet like a ( … )in' brain surgeon.

He had to know everything, this guy.

He'd find out the kind of inside stuff
nobody else knew,

and that's what he'd put his money on.

Even back home, years ago,
when we were first hangin' out together,

he'd know if the quarterback was on coke,

if his girlfriend was knocked up.

He'd get the wind velocity
so he could judge the field goals.

He even figured out the different bounce

you got off the different kinds
of wood they used

on college basketball courts, you know?

He'd be workin' on this ( … ) day and night.

There was nothing about a game
he was gonna bet that he didn't know.

Season after season,

the prick was the only
guaranteed winner I ever knew.

But he was so serious
about it all that I don't think
he ever enjoyed himself.

But that's just the way he was.

But back then, the bosses
didn't give a ( … )

about whether he enjoyed himself or not.

To them, he was a cash register.

All they had to do was
ring the bell and take money.

Especially Remo,
who was a ( … )in' degenerate
gambler who always lost.

I mean, unless Ace made his bets.

Ace made more money for them on a weekend

than I could do heisting
joints for a month.

Whatever Ace picked up
on the street, he told Remo.

You know, I mean, fixed fights, doped horses,

crooked ( … )in' zebras,
locked-in point spreads.

He told ( … )in' Remo everything.

And to tell you the truth,
I don't blame him.

Keepin' Remo happy with money

was the greatest insurance
policy in the world.

Son of a ( … )!

How the hell did you get
Oklahoma-Michigan?

Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi--
How the hell did you do it?

Well, that's why they paid so well.

You see? Never tells me nothin'.

Ace, what do we got on for next week?

Well, it's a little too early.
I'd say Thursday would be good.
I'll know by then. Is that all right?

Okay, you'll come by the house?
I'll come by.

7:00. Good job, my boy.
Keep it up. Okay, Ace.

Hey, Nick. [ Speaks Italian ]

I'll be right out. [ Italian ]

Nicky, see that guy?
Keep a good eye on him.

He's makin' a lot of money for us,

and he's gonna continue
makin' a lot of money for us,
so keep a good eye on him.

Not like your ( … )in' friends
out there that-- without brains.

Okay? All right.

[ Speaks Italian ] Yeah. Want me
to take this for you?

[ Nicky ] So now, on top
of everything else,

I gotta make sure nobody
( … )s around with the golden J( … )w.

[ Ace ] Yeah, we made a great pair.

I made book, and Nicky made sure
we always collected.

The old men loved us, and why not?

They all made money with us.

How did Nicky collect?

Don't ask.

Where the ( … ) is the money?
I don't see any money.

Hi, Melissa, Heidi. Hi, Sam.

Who's this guy?

Get the ( … ) out of here.
It was nine. I laid nine. It was eight.

Ace, tell him the line on the Bear game.

Eight.
If he don't know, nobody knows.

Told you it was eight.

Well, how come I laid nine?

'Cause you're a jag-off.

Excuse me. Is this your pen?
Yeah, that's my pen. Why?

No, it's a nice pen.
I just didn't know whose it was.

I thought it was yours.
I didn't want it to get lost.

Well, thank you. Why don't you take
that ( … )in' pen

and shove it up your ( … ),
you ( … )in' jag-off.

Well, I was just offering you the--

Look out, Joe. Look out.

[ Grunts ]

[ Groaning ]

What's that? You hear
a little girl, Frankie?

[ Sobbing ]

Hear a little girl, Ace?
Is that a little ( … )in' girl?

What happened to the ( … )in' tough guy

told my friend to stick it
up his ( … )in' ( … )?

Nicky, take it easy. Nicky, Nicky.

[ Whimpering ]

[ Ace ] While I was trying
to figure out why the guy
was saying what he was saying,

Nicky just hit him.

No matter how big a guy might be,
Nicky would take him on.

You beat Nicky with fists,
he comes back with a bat.

You beat him with a knife,
he comes back with a gun.

And if you beat him with a gun,
you better kill him,

because he'll keep coming back and back

until one of you is dead.

[ Nicky ]
Listen, with me protectin' Ace,

he made a fortune for the bosses.

I mean, that's what got him to Vegas.

He was a money machine.

A tremendous earner for these guys.

As soon as he took over,
he doubled the ( … )in' drop.

With Ace, the casino
never saw so much money.

And the bosses,
they couldn't be happier.

♪ I got $700 ♪

♪ Don't you mess with me ♪

♪ But you know I'm down ♪

♪ Everybody knows I'm down ♪♪

[ Ace ] In Vegas, I had to keep a few
juiced-in local cowboys working.

They were close to the,
you know, good old boys.

I mean, without us,
these guys, they'd still
be shoveling mule ( … ).

Ward, you've got to keep
a cleaner space.

If you need Mr. Clean,
page him, all right?

Won't happen again, Sam.

Mr. Rothstein.
Mr. Rothstein. Won't happen
again, Mr. Rothstein.

Is this guy just another dumb
( … )ing white man, or what?
What's the story?

You need this guy.

Can't get rid of him?

He's juiced in. He's the County
Commissioner's cousin.

I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.

[ Ace ] But still, I had no choice.
I had to take care of them.

These yokels ran the state.

They passed the laws.
They owned the courts.

I had dozens of politicians
and state officials

coming through that place every week.

Why not make him happy?

For politicians like
our state senator up there,
everything was on the house.

These guys won their comp life
when they got elected.

So, hey, why not take advantage of it?

Still, the politicians came cheap.
We could handle them.

It's a whale like K.K. Ichikawa,

who plays $30,000 a hand
in baccarat. That's the one
you really gotta watch.

He plays fast and big, and he
has the cash and the credit
to turn out your lights.

About a year ago he cleaned out
a couple of casinos
in the Cayman Islands.

Downstairs he takes us for two million,

and upstairs he takes
free soap, shampoo and towels.

Another billionaire cheapskate
who loved his free rooms,

free private jets
and two million of our money.

But we got him back.
I had our pilot tell him
the plane was on the fritz.

I don't know what the hell went wrong.
I'm awfully sorry.

I can't understand it.
These mechanical things,
you know they happen.

Hey, but better here than up there.
You know what I mean?

Then he missed the commercial flights
connecting with Japan.

I can't believe
that there's a convention.
There's no room.

We got him back with a whole floor
of rooms to himself.

I'm sorry you missed your plane.

You want to get my money back, right?
Oh, no. No gambling.

And once he was back, he played small.

He bet 1,000 a hand,
instead of his usual 30,000 a hand.

But I knew the trick
with whales like Ichikawa

was that they can't bet small for long.

He didn't think of it as winning 10,000.

He thought of it as losing 90,000.

So he upped his bets.

Until he dropped
his winnings back and gave up
a million of his own cash.

In the casino, the cardinal rule
is to keep them playing
and keep them coming back.

The longer they play,
the more they lose.

In the end, we get it all.

I'll be right back.

- See you, Ginger.
- Okay, thank you for asking.

She was a queen around the casino.

She brought in high rollers
and helped them spread
around a lot of money.

Hello.
Hey, Ginger. How you doing?

Great, and I have something
for you. You got me covered?

And you do. Thank you very much.
Take care of yourself.

I got some lucky pills for you, honey.
Oh, yeah?

[ Ace ] Who didn't want Ginger?
She was one of the best known,

best liked and
most respected hustlers in town.

Smart hustlers like her
could keep a guy awake

for two or three days
before sending him home broke

to the little woman
and his bank examiners.

How you doin' tonight?
Good. How are you?
Uh, beat.

[ Ace ] Ginger had the hustler's code.

She knew how to take care of people,

and that's what Vegas is all about.

It's kickback city.

She took care of the dealers,

pit bosses, floor managers,

but, mostly, she took care
of the valet parkers,

the guys who could get you anything
and take care of anything.

Ginger took care of the parkers
because they took care of
the security guards,

who took care of the metro cops,
who let her operate.

The valet parking job was such a moneymaker,

they had to pay off the hotel manager
just to get the concession.

But one thing
I just could never understand

was that she could have
everything under control

except for her old ( … )
boyfriend, Lester Diamond.

Gin, you know
I got other people in this.
I got partners.

I want you to understand
that I am looking out for you
in this thing, okay?

You're gonna get yours back,
and you're gonna get back first, okay?

All right, yeah. Where you going?

Where are you? You're in that place.
Where are you?

I'm here.
No, you're not.

Where are you? Where are you?

I'm always here for you.

You are.
I am.

[ Ace ] The Ginger I knew wouldn't
even look at this creep.

He was a moocher, a card cheat,

a country club golf hustler, a ( … )bag.

Chasing dentists for a few bucks.

I mean, the guy was always broke.
He always had a story.

And somehow she could never
turn him down.

The way Ginger saw it, I guess,
was that Lester was just an unlucky guy.

Somebody had to take care of him.

But nobody had to take care of Nicky.

If you find any cash in there,
we'll whack it up with you.

I mean, he took care
of himself only too well.

That's why every badge
back home wanted to nail him.

Don't look at me, pal.
I gotta live with her. Jesus Christ.

Even after a little vacation,
they hassled him at the airport.

I mean, Frank Marino
was there to meet him,
but so were the cops.

This time they wanted to pinch him

for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.

They were ready to blame him
for anything, no matter
where it happened.

And they were usually right.

Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster.

And he didn't give a ( … ) who knew it.
Come on, there we go.

Look at this. Beautiful!

I mean, that's what worried me.
'Cause it turns out, Nicky
was about to be sent to Vegas.

All right, we're clear.
I think that's it.
There's more. There's more.
There's a couple stuck in there.
I know there's more.

I'm telling you, they're out! Come on.

Don't get so defensive.
It could be stuck in your hair.

Oh, they're aren't-- Oh, they're aren't?

What's that? Huh? What's that?

There's no more. Thanks, hon.

[ Nicky ] I couldn't wait to get
my hands on Vegas.

But the bosses didn't send me out there
to have a good time.

They sent me out there to make sure that
nobody ( … )ed with Ace

and nobody interfered
with the ( … )in' skim.

Hey. Hey, how you doin'?

Hey, Sammy.

Boy, look at this place, huh?
Incredible.

All right. Welcome to Vegas.

Okay, Sammy.
Something, huh?

Yeah.

Ginger?

Holy ( … ). What've you
been doing out here?

[ Ace ] Honey, come here.

This is Jennifer and Nick.
They're dear friends of mine.

Hi, Jennifer. A pleasure.
Nice to meet you.

Okay, Sammy.

[ Ace ] After we ate, we left Jennifer
and Ginger alone,

and we took a ride to talk.

And then, he hit me with it.

What do you think about me
moving out here?

What's the matter?
You got a problem with that?

- No, of course not.
- You mean, I have your permission?

Sure, you have my permission.
But I just gotta tell you,
it's no joke out here.

It's no joke. You gotta keep
a low profile.

It's not like back home.
Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us.

And this sheriff's a real cowboy.

Even the coppers aren't afraid
to bury people out in the desert here.

I don't care. I wanna get away
from back home for a while.

I'm tired of that ( … ) back there.

Look at this place. It's made of money.

You know what the best part is?
Nobody's gonna know what we're doing.

There's nobody here to see us.
Everybody's back home.

Nick, I gotta tell you.
I got pinched twice for no reason.

You really gotta be careful.
I'm running a licensed place.
Everything's legit.

Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything.
What am I gonna do?

I'm especially not gonna
involve you in anything.

[ Nicky ] Ace saw Vegas one way,

but I saw it another.

I saw it as untouched.

I mean, they had bookies, ( … )s,

and drug dealers I could shake down.

Who the ( … ) were they gonna run to?

So I started gettin' everybody in line.

Best of all,
for the first time in my life,

I figured out a way not to lose.

[ Ace ] Yeah, he had a foolproof
scheme, all right.

It wasn't very scientific, but it worked.

When he won, he collected.

When he lost, he told the bookies
to go ( … ) themselves.

What were they gonna do, muscle Nicky?
Nicky was the muscle.

Hey, how you doin'? How you doin'?

You got that thing for me?
What thing?

Oh, Nicky. I thought you was layin'.

No, no, I'm takin' it. I was takin' it.

You sure?
I'm positive.

I'm a little confused.
You're a little confused?

Maybe if I stick your
( … )in' face through this window,

you'll get unconfused.

Gimme the ( … )in' money.
I'm sorry, Nick.
I didn't mean anything by it.

That's why you had it ready. You thought
I was ( … )in' layin' it?

My ( … )in' head. Your ( … )in' head, huh?

Smarten up. Don't ( … ) around, Tony.

And now Nicholas Santoro
will come up and tell us
about our first president.

George Washington was born--

[ Ace ] But still, it was nice
and quiet for a while.

Ginger and I presented
Nicky and Jennifer all over town

like regular Ozzie and Harriets.

[ Man ] You got a beautiful son.
[ Nicky ] Ace got my son, little Nicky,
involved in Little League.

Turned out one of
the other coaches was a ( … )in'
metro intelligence cop.

But it didn't matter.
It was all about the kids.

He's gotta realize
that everything can't be
a home run that he does.

That's exactly what
I keep tellin' him, but
that's the kind of kid he is.

Ever since he was born.
It's instinctive.

[ Ace ] And Nicky, being Nicky,
he made his presence known.

Especially at the casino,
where he definitely did not work,

people got the message.

[ Nicky ] Me, that's why the bosses
sent me out here.

They wanted me to make sure
none of the other crews
robbed the joint.

Like these two ( … )in'
balloon heads over here.

They were gonna try to bang us
out of 200 ( … )in' grand?
Yeah, right, I'm sure.
How are you? What are you doing here?

I'm over here now.
You're over here?

You're over here? 
Yeah, I'm over here with them.

We're waiting on Carmine.
Yeah, we're looking for Carmine.

He was here before.
He had a suitcase and everything
and then he left.

Carmine left? Carmine left?

He's gone?

He's not here?

Carmine's out?

I think maybe he went across the street
or somewhere else or somethin'.

Well, listen, good luck with the joint.

Ah, thanks, Eddie. Yeah, lots of luck.

Yeah, good luck to you too.
[ Man ] Hey, they forgot
to sign their papers.

They forgot to sign their papers.
They don't need those anymore.

[ Ace ] Outta respect,
guys from other crews
got away with a warning.

Everybody else, watch out.

Like these yokels here,
who never heard of Nicky
or the bosses back home.

'Cause they're the morons
who give you the most trouble.

Even after we'd catch them,
they'd try sneaking back with
beards and wigs and fake noses.

You can spot these ( … )holes
by watching the way they bet.

Like this guy,
he's bettin' lavender chips

at 500 each with only
one little problem.

He's always guessed right.

If he wasn't so ( … )in' greedy,
he'd have been tougher to spot.

But in the end, they're all greedy.

I saw that the dealer was weak,
but he wasn't in on it.

He just wasn't protecting his hand.

He was lifting
his hole card way too high.

Now, here's this guy reading
the dealer's hole card

and signaling his buddy at this table.

[ Electronic Beeping ]

And that's just what
these hustlers look for.

They cruise from casino to casino
looking for weak dealers

the way lions look for weak antelope.

[ Groans ]

Man down! I think we got a heart attack.

Go get medical.
We got a cardiac arrest here.

He's fine, folks.
Just give us some room, please.

[ Ace ] They never know what hit them.

And if and when they do find out
that they just got zapped
by a cattle prod,

they wish they really did
have a heart attack.

Turns out this guy and his ( … )in' pals,

they were knocking
this place dead for years.
He's got a wire on him.

Hey, hey, what are you doing?
There it is. That's it.

Cheater's justice.
Oh, God!

[ Whirring ]

No, no, no!

[ Ace ] I wanted
everybody to know that things
were changed around here.

We had to make an example
of these pricks,

that the party was over.

I'm just curious. I saw you
shuffling your checks
with your right hand.

Can you do that with both hands?
No.

You can't do it with both hands?
No, sir.

Can you do it with your left hand?

Well, I never tried.

So you're a righty.
Y-Yeah.

[ Screaming ]

[ Groans ]

Now you're gonna have to learn
with your left hand.

It's 100, 110, I think. Yes, it is.

Okay.

Hiya. That's a lot of money
to be counting out in public. Yeah.

Why don't I take him over to the office
and verify it?

A little privacy. By the way,
send over a nice bottle
of champagne on ice.

Sure will. Real special.

By the way, I'm Billy Sherbert, casino manager.
Hi.

Having a good time?
Yes.

You'll want to count
the money in privacy.

I have a plane to catch to Cleveland.
Can I get my winnings?

Look what they did to my hand, man.

All right, I'm gonna give you a choice:

You can either have
the money and the hammer
or you can walk out of here.

You can't have both. What do you want?
I just wanna get out of here.

And don't forget to tell
your friends what happens
if they ( … ) around here.

I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
You're ( … )in' right
you made a bad mistake.

'Cause if you come back here,
and we catch either one of you,

we're gonna break your heads
and you won't walk out of here.

You see that ( … )in' saw,
we're gonna use it. You got it?

Get out of here.

Thank you.

Throw him in the alley and tell the cops
he got hit by a car.

[ Ace ] Within no time,
everything was set in place.

We got rid of the freelance scamsters,
the per was way up,

the gods were happy,
or as happy as the gods can ever be,

and I decided to complicate my life.

For a guy who likes sure things,

I was about to bet the rest of my life
on a real long shot.

We're not gettin' any younger.
Don't you think it's time?

Aren't you gettin' tired
of this ( … )? Bangin' around?
Hustlin' around?

What, are you trying to handicap me?

I'm gonna do you one better.

I'm tryin' to marry you.

You wanna marry me?

I'm serious.

I wanna settle down. I want a family.

You got the wrong girl, Sam.

I know I'd be a good father.
I know you'd be a good mother.

You don't know me. You've known me
two, three months.

What do you know?

I'm 43 years old. I don't want to wait.

I know you well enough
to know that I really love you
very much.

And I can't think of anybody
better to be with.

And I don't feel like waiting anymore.

You know a lot of happily
married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.

Yeah, I know all that.

I care about you.

But I just don't have those
kind of feelings for you.

I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.

All right, all right.

Understand?

I'm sorry.

No, I-I--

I mean, that can grow.

As long as there's
a mutual respect, that
kind of thing can grow.

I'm realistic. I can accept that.

But, you know, what is love anyway?

It's a mutual respect. It's a devotion.

It's a caring
from one person to another.

And if we could set up
some kind of foundation

based on that mutual respect,

I feel eventually you would care
enough about me

that I could live with that.

If it doesn't work out,
doesn't play out,
then what happens to me?

You know I'm doing well now,
and I'm gonna do even better.

And so whatever happens,

if it doesn't work out between us,

I'm gonna make sure you're okay
for the rest of your life.

And if there are kids, especially,

I'll take care of you
better than you'd ever imagine.

What are you pitching me?
Just what I said.

You'll be set up
for the rest of your life.

That I can promise you.

Wanna take a chance?

[ Applause ]

[ Ace ] When I married Ginger,
I knew all the stories.

But I didn't give a ( … ).
I'm Sam Rothstein, I said.

I can change her.

[ Nicky ] It was typical Ace.

He invited the biggest people
in town, and he knew they'd show.

Because he knew they all wanted
somethin' from him.

With Ace, nobody ever got
a free ride, even Ginger.

With her, he still covered his bets.

They had to have the baby first
before they could get married.

He even made Jenny and me
watch Amy for a few days

when they went on their honeymoon.

- But I didn't mind. We loved the kid.
- [ Cheering ]

[ Lester ] Can you feel my eyes on you?

Can you feel me look into your heart?

Can you feel me
in the pit of your stomach?

Can you feel me in you?

In your heart?

Don't make me come there.

Answer me.

[ Ginger Crying ] I love you.

But, baby, do you know
that I love you too?

No, Lester. Do you know that?

Yeah.

This is the best thing I can do
for my life right now. That's right.

So it's going to be okay, isn't it?
Promise?

God. I wish you all the luck
in the world.

You do? Yeah, I do.

It's the best thing
you can do right now. I mean this.

You have real security.

Sweetheart, you're gonna be situated
just right, in Vegas.

Come on. This is great for us.

I'm always gonna be here for you.
I ain't going no place.

Huh? I'm lookin' at you right now.

I'm seein' you for the very first time,
right this minute.

I can feel my heart click.

I see you 14 years old.

I see you the first second
I ever saw you.

I see you long-legged little colt,

stupid braces on your teeth.

Okay, then. Every time I ever see you,
that's what I see.

Talk to you later.

Bye.

You all right?

Yeah.

Why are you crying?

I'm not crying. [ Sniffles ]

Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.

I'm okay. I just-- [ Sniffles ]

You just have to understand.

I've been with Lester since I was a kid.

I just wanted to say good-bye.

I just-- I don't--

I think I have a right to do that.

Okay?

It's all right.

That part of your life is over with.

Right? Yeah.

You're with me now. Yeah.

Right? Uh-huh.

You're sure? Yeah.

Yeah.

You wanna go? Let's go back in. Okay.

Oh!

[ Ginger ] Tsk. It's great.

It's great.

[ Shrieks ] It's all my stuff.
Oh, my God.

You brought all my stuff! I can't--

Try it on. It's yours.

You're kidding.

Oh, my God. What is it?

It's chinchilla. Oh, it's so soft.

Nice, isn't it?

No one's ever been so nice to me.

[ Gasps ] Oh!

Oh, my God!

So, do you think it's too much
if I wear these all on the same day?

You do whatever you want.

Do I keep my promises
or do I keep my promises? So wonderful.

The jewelry's not so bad either.
The only thing is--

We shouldn't keep this
in the house. We gotta
put it in the bank.

Come on. Can I keep this one
in the house?

Pay attention to me.

What I'm gonna tell you
is very important.

Okay.

All this stuff doesn't mean anything.

Money, this doesn't mean
anything without trust.

I have to be able
to trust you with my life.

[ Ace ] With over a million
in cash and jewels

tucked in a bank in Vegas,
only for Ginger,
she was secure and happy.

She loved that ( … ).

But a guy in my line of work has to have
a lot of payoff cash around.

Crooked cops and kidnappers,
they don't take checks.

Need a little help with that,
Mr. Collins?

So I put two million in cash
in a Los Angeles bank

under the name
of Mr. and Mrs. Tom Collins.

This was strictly my shakedown
and kidnapping money.

[ Ginger Laughs ]

And since I'd either be in jail
or locked in a closet

when I needed the money the most,

I gave Ginger the only key
to the cash that could
get me back alive.

[ Ace ] With Ginger and the money
in place, I felt covered.

And to play it safe,
I switched job titles again

and made myself, um,
Food and Beverage Director.

This way nobody would bother me
about a license.

I mean, Vegas was like a dream for me.

Trouble was, Nicky was dreaming
his own kind of Vegas.

[ Nicky ] To begin,
I put money out on the street
chargin' three points a week.

Juice to the ( … )in' dealers.
Don't make us come lookin' for you.

You won't have to look for me.

I appreciate it. Thanks, Nicky.

[ Nicky ] They were degenerate gamblers,
coke freaks.

In no time I had half
the dealers in the Tangiers
in my pocket.

Then, the next thing I did,
I started bustin' out
high-stakes poker players.

[ Ace ] It was so obvious.
All of Nicky's half-( … )ed
mechanics were signal-happy.

I'm gonna open for 500.

[ Ace ] Signaling back and forth.

[ Poker Player ]
Why you cryin' with two loaves
of bread under your arm?

Nicky thought nobody was watching him.
But he was wrong.

And I didn't want any of those agents
near my place.

- Four aces.
- I can't believe this.

[ Poker Player ] If I didn't have bad luck,
I wouldn't have any luck.

I wished to God Nicky and his whole crew
would just get lost.

What am I gonna do?
Go back home and start a war?

Nicky's a made guy and I'm not.
I can't do that.

Be careful. Gaming agents
are all over the place.

So I'm lucky. I'm not allowed
to get lucky in this place?

You've been lucky all week.
They're looking to nail you.

[ Nicky ] Ace was so ( … )in' worried
about his casino,

he forgot what we were doin'
out here in the first place.

A million times I wanted to yell
in his ( … )in' ear,

"This is Las Vegas. We're supposed to be
out here robbin', you dumb ( … )in' hebe."

[ Man ] Up 15. I raise you.

I don't give a ( … )
who he's connected to.

Tell him to take
his ( … )in' feet off the table.

What's he think this is,
a god( … ) sawdust joint?

Sir, would you mind
taking your feet off the table
and put your shoes on, please?

Yeah, I would mind.
I'm having a bad night.

( … )in' ( … )hole won't budge.

Call security.

- How are you?
- Good. How are you?

Good. Wanna do me a favor?
Take your feet off the table
and put your shoes back on.

( … ) you.

I want you to exit this guy
off the premises, and I want you
to exit him off his feet and use his head
to open the ( … )ing door.

Sir, you're gonna have to leave.

Mind accompanying us outside?
Bull( … ). I ain't goin' anywhere with you.

Bull( … ). You're outta here.
( … ) you! ( … ) you!

You know who you're
( … )ing with? Huh? Do you?

You ( … )ing ( … )! Do you know who
you're ( … )ing with?

Leave me alone! [ Grunting ]

You gotta be kidding me!

[ Ace ] Sure enough, an hour later,
I get the call.

Ace, what happened over there?
I mean, did you know that guy
you threw out was with me?

No, I didn't know that.
But you know what he did?

He insulted Billy.
Then I walked over to him politely,
and he tells me to ( … ) myself.

What?

Then he called me a ( … ).

What? H-Hold on. Hey, come here.

Then I threw that ( … )sucker out.

You called my friend a ( … )?
You tell him to ( … ) himself?

Is that what you did?
Tell him to go ( … ) himself?
[ Grunting ]

[ Grunting Continues ]
Come here. Come here.

Come here. You go over there right now
and you apologize.

You better hope he lets you back in.

If you ever get outta line again,
I'll smash your ( … )in' head so hard,

you won't be able
to get that cowboy hat on, you hear me?

( … )in' hick. Sammy, listen.

This guy obviously doesn't know
who he was talking to.

He doesn't know that we're dear friends.

I mean, he's already very sorry.

But if you could do me a favor
and let him back in,

I swear he'll never
get out of line again.

If he does it again, he's out for good.
I don't care what it is.

I'll never let him in the place again.
I'm sorry about this, really.

All right, Ace? Thanks, pal.

You took your boots off?
You put your feet on the table?

You ( … )-kickin',
stinky-horse-manure-smellin'
mother( … )er, you!

You ( … ) me up over there,
I'll stick you in a hole
in the ( … )in' desert.

You understand?
Go over there and apologize.
Nicky, I'm sorry.

[ Tiger Roaring ]

♪ You're dear to me ♪

♪ Yes, sirree ♪

[ Nicky ] You know, Ace could be
a very touchy guy.

Especially when he got
bigger and bigger in town.

Like when he hired that Jonathan
and David and their tigers
away from the Palace

by building them a new stage
and then giving them
a silver Rolls-Royce.

I'll tell you, he knew
how to bring in the crowds.

He knew all the ( … )in' angles.

He brought over the whole
Femme Fatale show from Paris,

but he forgot how lazy them
European dancing broads can get.

I mean, he had to weigh 'em in
once a week to make sure they
didn't blow up like balloons.

You're still eight pounds over.
What's the reason for this?

Mr. Rothstein, sir.
Let me put her on suspension.
Never mind the "sir."

Why is she eight pounds over?
I'm trying to offer you respect.

Mr. Rothstein is good enough for you.

Well, sometimes when you put
that pressure point on them--

All you do is give me answers.
Just give me the right answer.

I guess she's frightened.
If she doesn't lose the weight,
she may even get fired.

That's right. She will get fired.
Send her back to Paris--

It's been our policy--
Just stop everything.

This woman's an institution.
That's the problem. She's lazy.

[ Nicky ] Hey, I gotta
give the guy credit.

I mean, he does the most obvious thing.

This is the only town
in the country where
a bookie joint is legit.

So why not take advantage, right?

So, he took bookie joints off the street

and then opened them up
inside the casino.

Well, within a few years
by doing all of this,

he had every casino on the strip
trying to copy off of him.

[ Ace ] Between my innovations...

♪ Look like they're taking
some cat to jail ♪

...and Nicky's dedication to his job...

♪ Steamboats are comin',
and they're splashing and goin' ♪

...I soon had the best
operation on the strip.

♪ Moon is shinin' on friends below ♪

You gotta watch yourself.
There's a lot of heat on you already.

Why? Somebody's complainin'?

I'm hearing things from security.
They're all ex-cops.

The sheriff's lookin'
to bust your ( … )s. They wanna
put you in the Black Book.

That Black Book is a bunch of bull( … ).

They got two names
from the whole country,

and one of 'em is still Al Capone.

If they put you in that book,
you're gonna be in trouble.

You will not be able
to walk into a casino. I'm tellin' you.

What am I doing out here?
I'm trying to make a living, that's all.

I'm just tellin' you,
don't say I didn't warn you.

All right.

[ Man ] Mrs. Rothstein straight ahead.
Very nice. Thank you.

[ Chattering ]

[ Man ] For his hard work and dedication

and the new life blood
he has instilled in Las Vegas,

Sam has established himself
as an indispensable member
of the gaming community.

As the head of the
Tangiers Gaming Corporation,

it's my pleasure
to welcome Sam Rothstein

to the Vegas Valley Country Club.

[ Applause ]

[ Ace ] Back home, they would've put me
in jail for what I'm doing.

But out here, they're giving me awards.

It is with great pleasure
that I accept this certificate
of appreciation

for charitable foundations
of greater Las Vegas.

Congratulations, sweetheart.

Sam raised more than
we've ever raised before.

But my greatest pleasure
was watching my wife, Ginger,
work the room.

[ Man ] Thank you for everything.

They all loved her.
How could you not love her?

She could be the most
charming woman you ever saw.
People loved to be around her.

You've got to bring Amy
to Sasha's birthday party.
We'd love to have her there.

We'll see you 3:00 Saturday.

Yes, okay. Great.

She made everybody feel good.

♪ That's Stella by starlight ♪

Congratulations, Sam. Oh, thanks.

Hello, Mrs. Rothstein. How are you?
Hi. Oh.

You're one of the most gorgeous women
I've ever seen.

You're a lucky man, Mr. Rothstein.

Thank you. Thanks for that compliment.

He was a young kid from the casino.

Nice kid. Bright boy.

What ( … )s on this ( … )in' kid.
The next day I fired him.

Ginger had that effect on people.

I think she even encouraged them.

Do you wanna see this one? Ahhhh!

Daddy gave me all this jewelry
because he loves me so much.

But as much as they loved her,
Oh, fabulous!

they didn't know what really moved her.

Look at this. Look at this.
Daddy gave me this--

And with Ginger happy,
I was able to concentrate
on what I knew best.

Loose machines
are right back over there.

What are they doin' back there?
Bring them up here where they belong.

You can't even see 'em there.
Okay, I'll--

What about the progressives
or the high jackpots? Where are they?

These machines are hidden.
These are our best machines.
They bring all the action.

No wonder the drop is off.

The action is in the front.
Bring 'em up front.
All right, I will. I will.

Listen to me very carefully.
There are three ways of
doing things around here:

the right way, the wrong way and
the way that I do it. You understand?

I do understand that.
I'll get right on it. And thank you.
Don't thank me. Just do it.

You're the slots manager.
I shouldn't have to tell you this.

Dang, you are right. I am so sorry.

[ Ace ] So I ended up working,
what, 18-hour days?

Ginger was the one who wound up enjoying
the best of Vegas.

Come with me, please.
I have a better table for you.
I'm sorry.

What did you say to that jerk anyway?

I told him I was Mrs. Sam Rothstein.

[ Chuckles ] Well, you might as well
get something out of it.

[ Ace ] Well, it wasn't long
before what I was afraid
was gonna happen... happened.

Nicky managed to get himself
banned from every casino in Las Vegas.

And from then on, I couldn't
be seen talking to him
anywhere in Vegas or near it.

What the ( … ) is that supposed to mean?
"That should amount to gaming,

and he will be ejected from any casino
in Las Vegas.

And the casinos can be fined
as much as 100,000

every time he shows up."

You believe this ( … )?
Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.

"With his notorious
and unsavory reputation--" Mother( … )er.

Unsavory ( … )in'--

Is there any way around this?

No, there's no way.

Let's say, for instance,

I wanna go in a restaurant,
which happens to be in the casino,

to get one of those sandwiches I like--
Forget it.

You can't even set foot
in the parking lot.

That's how serious it is.

In other words, I'm ( … )ed.
In so many words, yes.

[ Ace ] It just didn't sink into
his head about the Black Book
and what it meant.

Not being able to go into a casino
is just one thing,

but being in this book etched your name
into the brains

of every cop and FBI agent in the state.

I mean, you're listed
in there with Al Capone.
But Nicky didn't care.

I gotta do something.
They ain't gettin' rid of me.

They're not gettin' rid of me.
I'm stayin' here.

( … ) 'em. ( … ) 'em.

[ Nicky ] So once they pulled that ( … ),

I started doin' my own things in Vegas
nobody ever thought of doin'.

To keep an eye on things,
I brought in my kid brother, Dominick,

and some desperados from back home

and started knockin' over
high-rollers, casino bosses,

bookmakers-- anybody right here in town.

I had a good ( … )in' crew goin' for me,
I'll tell you that.

I had Sal Fusco,
a great second-story guy.

Jack Hardy. He worked for a safe company
before he did a six-year bit.

And then there was Bernie Blue.
This guy can bypass any alarm for me.

It was like old times.

And I opened up
my own jewelry store too, the Gold Rush.

Sometimes I used to go along on a heist,
just for the fun of it.

But I didn't like the people
I was rippin' off looking at me,

so I used to turn
their ( … )in' pictures around.

- What's takin' so long?
- This peter's a mother( … )er.

It's working.
Learn how to open these things
so you don't have to take 'em.

Some of these stones
got a lot of n( … )s in them.

Tell Pepe if he's switching
stones on us, he better take
a camel back to Nigeria.

[ Phone Rings ] Yeah?

- They're in Penthouse K.
- Check in alone?

- They checked in alone.
- Are they out now?

- Yes. Don't worry.
- All right. Thanks.

[ Ace ] He had tipsters
all over town. Bellmen,

valet parkers, pit bosses.

Secretaries.

- Mint condition coins.
- Mint condition? All right.

And they all got a piece of the score.
Car's coming.

They were very careful.

They always bypassed
the alarms, or else,

if not, they'd drill
enough holes to knock through
the walls with a sledgehammer.

Nicky was grabbing everything he could.

Nobody out there
was expecting a guy like him.

For Nicky, Las Vegas
was the ( … )ing Wild West.

I just got a shipment
of diamonds from Israel.

[ Nicky ] What the ( … )
they expect from me?
I had to earn, didn't I?

You know, this diamond has flaws in it.

- There's no flaws.
- Don't tell me.
I'm doing this for 25 years.

You better clean your loupe,
because there's no flaws
in these diamonds.

[ Nicky ] Whenever we got local merch,

we'd usually send it
to Palm Springs or Arizona, L.A.

I had a couple of sand n( … )s
out there. You know, Arabs.

What, are you gonna have
a ( … )ing meeting here
or you gonna buy some diamonds?

I know his language.
I'm talking with him.

Forty thousand dollars,
you buy the whole package.

Twenty thousand. That's my final offer.

All of a sudden he talks
English. Let's talk Turkey.
Twenty-five thousand.

[ Nicky ] I actually turned my bedroom
into a bank vault

where I kept the choice stuff.

I couldn't leave it
at the Gold Rush in case
we got raided by the cops

or if my crew got cute.

I had the only key.
Jennifer didn't give a ( … ).

She used to fall asleep
on the couch watching
television every night.

This stuff was all mine.
I didn't send any of this back home.

Actually, I couldn't,
because I wasn't even
supposed to be doin' it.

The bosses were making
so much ( … )ing money with the casinos

that they didn't want anybody
makin' any waves for them.

You gave all the guys
in your crew a piece of that?

I took care of everybody. Yeah?

That's why there was no real
organized street stuff in Vegas
before I came here.

But how much cash
could I bury in my closet?

You have to understand,
and I'm sure you do,
that in a venture of this kind,

you have to be prepared
to take some kind of loss.

So I put some of the money
into legitimate deals
with Charlie Clark.

He was Ace's banker.

You will try to push it through,
won't you, Mr. Clark?

Yes. I'm giving you 50,000 cash.

[ Nicky ] Then I put some more money
into legitimate places,
like my restaurant.

Is that the last one? Yeah.

I had my kid brother,
Dominick, run it for me.

( … )ers.

Here you go, guys. All right.

Thanks a lot. Yeah. Enjoy.
Have a good time.

Choke on it, mother( … )er.

Hey, Dom. How ya doin'?

[ Ace ] Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants.
He was a real restaurant buff.

And over the years,
he always made money with it.

In Vegas, he had the Leaning Tower.
It was a very popular spot.

He had politicians,
showgirls and movie stars
hanging out all over the place.

That show over at the Flamingo
gets better and better.

By the way, Sammy said,
whenever you have a minute,
give him a call.

Made a messenger out of you too, huh?
I'll do anything for a buck.

He does it to everybody.
Enjoy your dinner. Thanks.

[ Ace ] But I gotta tell you,
the thing Nicky liked most
was the showgirls, naturally.

I mean, to them,
Nicky was the movie star.

You walk past me? Hey, this is Shelly.

Hey, Shelly. How are you? Hi.

And this is Stacy. Stacy.

This is Nick. Pleasure.

We're gonna have dinner. Come on.
All right.

Let's check the kitchen first.
Excuse us one second.

Come on. I'll show you.
I fly stuff in fresh every day.

I get bread from back home.
I get fish from California.

And you can always tell
a great kitchen like ours
because of the milk-fed veal.

That's the secret. See, milk-fed veal
is pure white.

Out here, they got that pink veal.
Slide over, honey.

Now, pink veal, you can
pound that ( … ) for two days.

It'll never, ever get tender.
You know what I mean?

I left here with the money.
Got muscled on the street.

A couple guys, I owe them.
So I gave them the money.
That's what I did.

Yeah? Yeah.

You call yourself a man?

You know you're a lyin'
lowlife, mother( … )in'
gamblin' degenerate prick?

You know that's what you are?
Two small kids at home.

I gave you money to pay the ( … )in' rent

and buy groceries, put the heat on.

Your wife called Frankie
and told him the ( … )in'
heat's off. Huh?

You didn't gamble that ( … )in' money?
Stand here and tell me that?

No? You didn't? I didn't--

Don't ( … ) with me, Al!
Don't make a ( … ) outta me.

You wanna embarrass me
and make a fool outta me?
You didn't gamble?

Tell me you gambled the ( … )in' money,

I'll give you the ( … )in' money
to put the ( … )in' heat on!

Did you gamble? Huh?

( … )in' degenerate, you.

( … )in' kids at home.

Here. Get the ( … ) outta here.

Thanks, Nick. Yeah, thanks.

Let me find out you ( … )ed up.
I'll leave you where I find you.

How many of these you gonna eat?

Two. Two?

[ Ace ] But around 6:30 in the morning,
when he finished his day,

no matter where he was
or what he was doing,

he always went home to make breakfast
for his son, Nicky boy.

I know you like this.
A little butter, right?

Not a lot. You know why, right? Yeah.

Why? 'Cause it clogs up your heart.

What a smart kid you are. Okay, eat.

[ Nicky ] Every couple of weeks,

I used to send Marino back to the bosses
with a piece of what I made.

Not a big piece. But ( … ) them.
What did they know?

They were 1500 miles away,
and I don't know anybody
who can see that far.

Their drop was a truck stop garage

where Remo and the guys
used to hang out and count
their millions.

I mean, the cops knew,
but they didn't give a ( … ).
They all worked it out.

But I knew how to keep the bosses happy.

Whenever they gave me little jobs to do,
you know, to send a message,

I would carry things out to a "T."

Like the time Tony Dogs,
who's supposed to be the new
maniac tough guy in town,

shot up one of Remo's bars.

Here's a ( … )in' guy
kills two of Remo's guys

and a poor ( … )in' waitress
who was just workin' on her
night off, of all things.

I mean, this guy's just beggin'
to be made an example of.

Frankie, I want all of the names
of all the other people he had with him.

And I don't care what you have
to do to 'em to get 'em, understand?

I'll take care of it, Remo.
[ Speaking Italian ]

[ Nicky ] To be truthful with you, I had
to admire this ( … )in' guy.

He was one of the toughest
Irishmen I ever met.

This son of a ( … ) was tough.

For two days and two ( … )in' nights,
we beat the ( … ) outta this guy.

I mean, we even stuck
ice picks in his ( … )s.

But he never talked.

In the end, I had to put
his ( … )in' head in a vise.

Dogs. Dogs, can you hear me, Dogs?

Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head
in a ( … )in' vise.

I'm gonna squash your
( … )in' head like a grapefruit
if you don't give me a name.

Don't make me have to do this.
Please. Come on!

Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.

( … ) you.

This mother( … )er. You believe this?
Two ( … )in' days and nights.

( … ) me? ( … ) me? You mother( … )er!

( … ) my mother?
Is that what you're tellin' me?

[ Skull Crunching ]
You mother( … )er, you! Huh?

Oh, God! Give me the ( … )in' name!

[ Grunting ] Ch-Charlie M.

Charlie M.? Charlie M.

You make me pop your
( … )in' eye outta your head

to protect that piece of ( … )?!

Charlie M.?!

You dumb mother( … )er!

Kill me, you ( … )! Kill me!

Kill you?

You mother( … )er, you!

Frankie, do him a ( … )in' favor.

[ Ace ] The word got around
that finally,

there was a real gangster in town.

Nicky was the new boss of Las Vegas.

Charlie M.

[ Bells Ringing ]

Four reels, sevens,
across three $15,000 jackpots?

Do you have any idea what the odds are?

Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.

Three ( … )in' jackpots in 20 minutes?

Why didn't you pull the machines?
Why didn't you call me?

Well, it happened so quick.
Three guys won. I didn't
have a chance to call you.

You didn't see the scam? You didn't see
what was going on?

Well, there's no way to determine that, Sam.

Yes, there is-- an infallible way! They won!

Well, it's a casino.
People gotta win sometimes.

Hey, Ward, you're pissing me off.

Now you're insulting my intelligence.

What do you think, I'm a ( … )ing idiot?

You know god( … ) well somebody
had to get into those machines
and set those ( … )in' reels.

The probability on one four-reel machine
is a million and a half to one.

On three machines in a row,
it's in the billions.

It cannot happen, would not happen,
you ( … )in' momo!

What's the matter with you? Didn't you
see you were being set up on the second win?

I really think you're--

Wait. You didn't see that
you were being set up on the second win?

I really think you're overreacting
to this whole--

Listen, you ( … )in' yokel.
I've had it with you.

I've been carrying your ( … )
in this place ever since I got here.

Get your ( … ) and get your things
and get outta here.

- You're firing me?
- I'm firing you.

No, I'm not firing-- I'm firing you.

You might regret this.

I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.

This is not the way to treat people.

Listen, if you didn't know you're being scammed,

you're too ( … )in' dumb
to keep this job.

If you did know, you were in on it.
Either way, you're out!

Get out. Go on. Let's go.

The guy's history
as far as I'm concerned. History.

But you can't just fire him.

Webb's his brother-in-law
He's county commissioner.

So what?

Everybody out here with cowboy boots is
a ( … )in' county commissioner

or related to a county commissioner.

I'm ( … )in' sick of it.

This is his state.

His uncle's chief judge.
His brother-in-law runs
the county commission.

I don't know how many other relatives
he's got in this town.

There's gotta be a way
to work him back in.

Phil, I can understand.
You're in the finances. You're upstairs.

But you are not on the floor.
You don't see what's going on.

I've got thousands of players.
I've got 500 dealers.

They're all looking
to rob me blind 24 hours a day.

I have to let them know
I'm watching all the details
all the time,

that there is not one single thing
I will not catch as I am over here.

Look at yours.

What?

Look at that.

Look at this. There's nothing.

Look how many blueberries
your muffin has and how many mine has.

Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
What are you talking about?

It's like everything else in this place.

If you don't do it yourself,
it never gets done.

Where are you going?

From now on, I want you to put
an equal amount of blueberries
in each muffin.

An equal amount of blueberries
in each muffin.

Do you know how long
that's going to take?

I don't care how long it takes.
Put an equal amount in each muffin.

Come on, honey. Just a little.

That a girl. That a girl.

- Mama.
- Oh, boy, look. You wanna go to Mommy?

Wanna come to Mommy?
It's all right, sweetheart.

I need to talk to you.
I need some money.

What do you need?

You got her? Okay.

Well, I need a lot.
I need more than usual.

Why don't you take it
out of your account?
There's a lot there.

Well, I would, you know, Sam.
It's just that--

Well, I need more than that.
I need 25,000.

Twenty-five thousand?

For yourself?

Yeah.

Why do you need that much?

What's the difference? I just need it.

Well, I mean, I gotta ask you.
That's a lot of money.

You're not asking for a box of popcorn.

I'm aware of that.
We don't have to turn this
into a big deal.

Okay? We don't have to have a fight.

It was important to me. But forget it.

Just something
I wanted to do for myself.

Who's fighting?
I mean, tell me what it's for.

Why can't you tell me
what it's for? Huh?

Well, you know what?
Now I want you to tell me.

My wife comes to me
and asks me for 25,000.

- What do you want? Do you want a coat?
- No.

If you want a coat, you got it.
You know that.

It's not the money. Why do you want it?

That's all I'm asking.
Am I not entitled to ask that?

Sam, I've been independent
my whole life.

I never had to ask anybody for anything.

Now you're making me beg you for this.

What are you talking--

And you're embarrassing me.
Why do you want to make me feel so bad?

You're asking me for 25,000.
I'm not out to make you feel bad.

I wanna just be able to trust you.
You know, it's about trust.

I have to be able
to trust you with my life.
Do you understand?

Can I trust you?

Can I trust you?

Can I trust you?

Answer me. Can I trust you?

You can trust me.

Good. So then you could tell me
what the money is for.

- [ Grunting, Shouting ]

It's not his fault! It's my fault!

[ Shouting Continues ]

No!

- ( … ). ( … ).
- Piece of ( … ).

[ Sobbing ]

[ Ace ] You did it to yourself,
you chicken( … ) ( … )sucker!

He's such a prick.

He had some guy
from the hotel beat him up.

He didn't want to do it himself.

Oh, no, he didn't want
to get his own hands dirty.

So why did he have to do that, huh?

Tell me.

I know it wasn't a nice thing to do--
No ( … ).

You gotta understand it.
He doesn't know if this guy
is shaking you down

or taking advantage of you.

No. No.

I told him all about this guy
before we ever got married.

- This is no ( … )ing surprise.
- Oh, you did? I didn't know that.

Yeah. He's just a friend of mine
I was trying to help. So what?

You know, the first time I ever
saw you guys together,

I never saw him so happy.

I mean, I know he's a crazy Jew ( … )
and everything,

but I never seen--
you know, I never seen him act
like that with anybody else.

I think he's crazy about you.
I mean, he really loves you.

He does. Come on.

I went into this with
my eyes open, you know.

I knew the bottom
could drop out at any time.

I'm a working girl, right?

You don't think I'm gonna go
into a situation like this

if I don't think I'm gonna
get covered on the back end.

Sure. I can see that. Sure. Right?

So I put aside some jewelry for me.
A lot of jewelry.

You mean like a lot
of expensive jewelry? About how much?

You want to steal it?

No. I'm just curious, you know.

I was wondering how much he would put
into a thing like that.

I'm told it's worth
about a million dollars, maybe more.

Well, there you go.
What does that tell you?

A million dollars in jewelry.

Does that tell you the guy is crazy
about you or what?

I should've never married him.
He's a Gemini.

Triple Gemini. Duality.

Gemini is the snake, you know.
You can't trust a snake.

[ Sniffles ] I mean it.

I know what you mean. Listen, Ginger.

You know, this is probably not--
I don't have the answers anyway.

This is probably not what you
want to hear right now...

I do.

...'cause you're a little upset with Ace,
and I understand that.

But, you know, I think you should try
to make the best of it now.

Go slow. You know. See what happens.

He could've killed him.
Okay? He could've killed him.
He didn't have to hit him.

It's not exactly like
I'm sleeping with the guy.

And he makes me sneak around
to see my own friends.

What the ( … ) is that all about?

I guess it's 'cause
he loves you so much.
He's jealous and worried.

He gives a ( … ) what I do?

Look, I'll try to find out

When I see him, I'll talk to him. Okay.

All right? Yeah.

[ Phone Ringing ]

Mr. Rothstein,
County Commissioner Pat Webb
is here to see you.

- Give me a minute.
- Okay. Just a minute.

Mr. Webb, can I get you anything?

Uh, no. No, thank you, little lady.

Okay, send him in,
then call me four minutes after.

Mr. Rothstein, I'm Pat Webb.
How do you do?

Hey, it is a pleasure.
I heard a lot about you.

Oh, thank you, sir.
Hey, house is doin' well.

Hey, all that money is rollin' in.

I appreciate you takin' the time
to see a poor ol' civil servant.
Oh, it's quite all right.

Why don't you have a seat, hmm?
Oh, thank you, sir.

I come here personally
to kind of smooth over

any fracas about a certain matter.

See, uh, maybe you didn't know it,

but Don Ward is a very well-liked man
in this town.

He's got lots of friends here.
Nice family, and their money
go back many, many years.

Now, friends vote.
Family and money votes.

That's important to me and you.

And if you'll think
about our little problem
along them lines--

and you'll forgive me for sayin' it--

maybe he did not deserve to be fired.

I'm sorry, but he knew
about our getting hit

on three big machines in a row,
and he did nothing about it.

That means either he was in on it or--

forgive me for saying this--
he was too dumb
to see what was goin' on.

Either way, I cannot have
a man like that working here.

Before we point
the dirty end of the stick at old Don,

we better be sure
we can prove them charges.

Believe me, if I could prove it,
he would be under arrest.

Are, uh-- [ Clears Throat ]

Are we certain that you want
the Gaming Control Board

eyeballing your record
and your gangster pals
like Nicky Santoro.

I think you're way out of line
talking to me like that.

What you're saying is libelous,
and you're in no position
to challenge my expertise.

I went way out of my way
to be very helpful
and courteous to that kid.

He's weak. He's incompetent.
He jeopardizes the whole place.

There's not much more I can do for him.

You have got me there. [ Chuckles ]

Old Don is as useless as ( … )s on a boar.

[ Coughs ] But he is my brother-in-law,

and I would look on it
as a personal favor

if you'd think some more
on hirin' him back.

I can't do that.

And I appreciate the fact
that he's your brother-in-law,

and I do want to help you
and I like to do favors.

And I know who you are,
but I cannot do that.

Well, could there be any position

farther down the trough?

I'm sorry. I can't do anything.

He's too incompetent,
and the bottom line is
he cannot be trusted.

[ Ringing ]

Okay. Thanks.

Well, you know, that's it. I'm sorry.

Mr. Rothstein, your people
never will understand

the way it works out here.

You're all just our guests.

But you act like you're at home.

Let me tell you somethin', partner.
You ain't home.

But that's where we're gonna send you
if it harelips the governor.

Thank you for your time.

No problem.

Sorry. You bet.

What happened to my pills?

- [ Ginger ] Huh?
- Isn't it bad enough
you're drinking too much?
You're taking all my pills too?

I didn't take your pills.

Look, for my ulcer,
I take a half a one of these.

A half of one of these.
And that's when I have extreme pain.

I had a three-month supply.
What did you do with 'em?

[ Crying ] You didn't have
to beat him up.

What?

I was just trying to help him.

It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy.

Yeah, how do I know?

You can't make me stop
caring about people.

What? What?

[ Sniffles ] I said, you can't make me

stop caring about people.

[ Crying Continues ]

Listen.

Ginger.

I'm trying to make the best
of everything here, you know?

I mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes.
I mean, people look up
to you in this town.
I don't know what to do.

You know what, Ace? I don't give a ( … ).

I'm gettin' out of here.

I am.

[ Sobs ]

Come over here.

You gotta get hold of yourself.
Okay.

If not for me, at least for Amy.
Okay.

Understand? Your drinking's gettin'
way out of hand.

I'm gonna get you into a program.
They got plenty of good ones.

I don't need one.
Yes, you do. It's very discreet.

There's no names in the papers.
You don't have to worry
about any of that stuff.

That's all you care about.

You don't care about me.

Yes, I-- Yes, I do.

No, you don't.
How could you say that?

You're a beautiful woman.
You're destroying yourself.

You don't need that stuff.
You don't need that ( … )in'
leech living off you.

I know you better
than you know yourself.

You're a tiger.
You're stronger than I am.

And when you set your mind
on doing something,
you do it better than anybody.

[ Sobs ]

You're gonna do it. You'll do it.
Oh, God.

Oh, God.

Okay.

Okay.

I'll try. I'll try.

I'll try.

I will.

Don't be mad at me, okay?

I will.

[ Nicky ] No matter what the problems
were outside the count room,

it was all worth it.

The cash kept rollin' in.

And the suitcases kept comin' and goin'.

And let me tell you, the ( … )in'
bottom line here is... cash.

The only problem was that after a while,

the bosses noticed that the suitcases
were gettin' a little light.

Aspet, wait a minute.
You mean to tell me

that the money we're robbing
is being robbed?

That somebody's robbing from us?

We go through all this ( … )in' trouble,
and somebody's robbing us?

- Huh?
- [ Nance ] Like I said, you know,

it's part of the business.

It-It's considered leakage.

Leakage, my ( … )s. I want the guy
who's robbing us.

[ Nicky ]
Even John Nance-- that's the guy
who ran the scam--

he knew there wasn't much
you could do about it.

You gotta know that
a guy who helps you steal--

even if you take care of him real well--

I mean, he's gonna steal
a little bit extra for himself.

Makes sense, don't it? Right?

Well, you go try
and make these hardheaded
old greaseballs understand that.

What's the point of skimming
if we're being skimmed?

It defeats the whole purpose
of what we're doing out there.

- Huh?
- You know, they take this money
because they're my guys.

So you gotta give 'em some leeway.

[ Nicky ] But the bosses
never believed in leeway,

so listen to what they do.

They put Artie Piscano,
the underboss of K.C.,

in charge of making sure
nobody skimmed the skim.

What you been doin' out there?
I was out there with my goomat.

Goomat? What are you doin'
with your goomat?

What else? I gave her a schiaff.

[ Nicky ] The only trouble was,
Piscano was a disaster.

This guy could ( … ) up a cup of coffee.

What you been doin' out there?
I'm out there more than I'm here.

[ Nicky ] And little did anybody know
where this would all lead.

If they did,
they would've been better off
makin' ( … )in' novena.

You gotta go back there
and talk to that guy.

Go back? I never got paid my expenses
for the last trip.

What expenses?

I'm goin' all over, layin' money outta
my own pocket,

and I never get anything back.

What the hell's goin' on?
You gotta go back out there.

Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start
keepin' records.

Artie. No records, Artie.

What are you gonna do
with records-- pay taxes?

I keep layin' out my own
( … )in' dough for these trips
and nothing ever comes back.

What the hell are we doin' over here?

You're goin' out to Las Vegas.
You're having a good time at my expense.

What the ( … )? I mean, after all--

[ Ace ] No matter how many novenas
you could make,

nothing was gonna stop what came up next
at the casino.

I can't believe you're doing this.

[ Woman ] We made a deal.
You came to me.

[ Ace ] It turned out Phil Green,
Mr. Integrity,

had a partner nobody knew about,

and when she showed up
and started demanding some money
from the Tangiers--

Why are you doing this to me?

Because you're wrong. I'm not wrong.

- Yes, you are.
- No, I am not wrong.

[ Ace ] ...Green tried to stonewall her.

I will see to it that you
do not get away with this.

So she sued him in court.

The court will now hear
the matter of the plaintiff, Anna Scott,

against Tangiers Corporation
and its president, Phil Green.

Good morning, Your Honor.
John Momot on behalf of Mr. Green.

Mitchell Logan on behalf of Anna Scott.

- [ Judge ] Mr. Logan, you can proceed.
- Thank you, Judge.

I believe he was
absolutely fair, and I'm
delighted with the decision.

We got a problem.

It didn't go too well.

Green has to open up the books,
has to show how he got the financing.

Hey, that's-- that's not good.

[ Nicky ] She was doin' pretty good
with her lawsuit.

But before she could start
countin' her money,

the boys back home decided
to settle the case out of court instead.

So they sent me.

[ Three Gunshots ]

[ Reporter ] Can you comment
on the murder of Anna Scott?

What are you talking about?
[ Reporter ] She was found
last night shot in the head.

[ Reporter #2 ] Was this just
a real estate partnership?

[ Reporter #3 ] Her lawyer said
you were partners.

We were involved
in minor real estate deals
many years ago.

It was never a partnership.
Do you have ties to organized crime?

Did you ever hear
of the .22 caliber killer?

[ Ace ] Now, instead of the cops
only looking at Nicky,

they started looking at Green too.

And he was supposed to be
our squeaky-clean front man.

So I had to start giving interviews

to make sure everybody knew
the casino was on the up-and-up.

So, actually, how often do you
really fill in for him?

Green's here about two
or three times a month.

And he's busy with other
real estate deals and things, you know.

So in Green's absence, then,
you're the boss?

I serve at the pleasure
of the chairman of the board,

and... my responsibilities
are to run the day-to-day operations.

So day-to-day, then, you're the boss?

Well, in a sense, you could say
that I am the boss

when Mr. Green is away.

You could say that.

[ Webb ] Hmm. Have you read this?

Hmm? About Mr. Rothstein.

It says, "The Midwest bookmaker
with mob ties

says that he is the real boss
of the $100 million
Tangiers casino empire."

You believe that?
Did he really say that?

Why, of course he really said that.
It's right here.

Has that man even filed
for his license yet?

I don't know.
We have to check the files.

Well, without gettin'
your shorts in a knot,
would you-- would you do that?

And kinda check closely,
'cause we may have to kick
a kike's ( … ) outta town.

Thank you.

A Gaming Control Board investigation

of Tangiers executive
Sam Rothstein's application
for a gaming license is under way.

Rothstein, who heads
the Tangiers Casino operation

and is a boyhood friend
of Las Vegas mob boss Nicky Santoro,

could lose his ability
to work in the casino--

[ Sound Off ]

[ Phone Rings ]

Hello?

I gotta meet Clean Face right away.
What about the Chez Paris?

You can't. You gotta make a reservation.
It's all booked up.

No, no, it's okay. It's impossible.
It's booked up.

You got to make a reservation.
It's very difficult to get in.

It's okay. I'll use the service entrance.

I'll see you at 9:00.

Uh-- All right.

The battle between
state gaming officials

and Tangiers Casino boss
Sam "Ace" Rothstein is heating up.

Tonight, an up-to-the-minute look

at Ace Rothstein's attempt
to get state licensing

despite law enforcement allegations

of Rothstein's
organized crime connections.

Will Sam Rothstein's friendship

with alleged organized crime figure
Nicky Santoro

keep Rothstein from running
the Tangiers Casino?

And can the integrity
of state gaming laws be jeopardized

by a boyhood friendship?

Why don't you take it easy
with that stuff? Huh?

Come on. Let me help you down. Come on.

We're talking about some stuff.

Will a boyhood friendship
unseat Rothstein
as the Tangiers Casino boss?

Exclusive on
the KVVO Special News Report.

Go down. Just go downstairs.

You can't let this concern you, Ace.
Don't worry about that stuff.

It's just a political witch hunt.

Hi, Ace.

You want something to drink?

- Charlie, you want a refill?
- Yeah, a refill would be great.

No, I don't want nothin'.
Mr. Clark, how you doin'? Good.

I've been tryin' to reach you.
You're tougher to get
than the president.

Well, I've been busy.
Yeah, at least you could do
is return my phone calls though.

Listen, Nicky, we talked about this.

And, uh, I explained to you
that there was the possibility

you might have
to take some kind of loss.

Yeah. I think I want my money back.

What are you gonna do, strong-arm me?
[ Chuckles ]

You know, I think that you've gotten
the wrong impression about me.

I think, in all fairness,

I should explain to you
exactly what it is that I do.

For instance, tomorrow morning,
I'll get up nice and early,

take a walk down over to the bank

and walk in and see you,

and, uh, if you don't have
my money for me,

I'll crack your
( … )in' head wide open in front
of everybody in the bank.

And just about the time
that I'm comin' out of jail,

hopefully you'll be comin'
out of your coma.

And guess what.
I'll split your ( … )in' head open again.

'Cause I'm ( … )in' stupid.
I don't give a ( … ) about jail.

That's my business. That's what I do.

Now, we know what you do,
don't we, Charlie?

You ( … ) people out of money
and get away with it.

You can't talk to me like that.

You fat Irish prick,
you put my ( … )in' money to sleep.

You go get my money, or I'll put your
( … )in' brain to sleep.

- Sam--
- Never mind ( … )in' Sam.
This is personal.

I'll be there in the morning.
You can ( … )in' try me, fatso.
You ( … )in' try me.

- You think he got the point?
- What are you doin'?

He's a square guy, for chrissakes.
You can't treat him like that.

He's gonna run to the FBI.

( … ) the FBI.
That prick's been dodgin' me
for three weeks.

All of a sudden, you're tryin'
to tell me what to do all the time.

I'm not tryin' to tell you what to do,
but you were way outta line.

What are you doing? Where's your head?

Where's my head?
Where's your ( … )in' ( … )s? Huh?

I'm tryin' to put somethin'
really big together out here.

You know what I'm talkin' about. Huh? You know.

If you're actin' like this now,
how can I depend on you?

There's a lot of things gonna change out here.

And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy,
you're gonna have to go my ( … )in' way.

Nick, understand my situation.
I'm responsible for thousands of people.

I got 100 million a year
goin' through the place.

It's all over-- It's all over
if I don't get that license.

Believe me, if it
goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad
for a lot of people. You understand?
Yeah, forget about your ( … )in' license.

I plant my own flag out here,
you ain't gonna need a ( … )in' license.

I don't know what it is, Sammy,
but the more I talk to you,

the more I feel like you just
don't want to go along with me. Is that it?

No, I don't wanna come along with you.

I'll be honest with you.
All right. Fine.

I don't wanna be involved
in anything you're talking about, okay?

I just wanna run a square joint. That's it.
I just want my license.

I want everything nice and quiet. That's it.

Quiet like this?
"I'm the boss"? That's quiet?

That's all taken out of context.
I had no control over that.

Ronnie and Billy were there.
They'll tell you exactly what happened.

Back home, they don't know
about ( … )in' control. That looks bad.

Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.

Every time you're on television,
I get mentioned. That looks bad.
What the ( … ) happened to you?

What happened to you?
You lost your control. I lost control?

Yes, you lost control.
Look at you. You're walkin'
around like John Barrymore.

A ( … )in' pink robe
and a ( … )in'-- a cigarette holder?
I lost control?

I didn't wanna bring this up,

but you been treatin'
a lot of people with a lot of
disrespect, even your own wife.

My wife? Yeah.

What does she have to do with this?

She came to see me. She was upset
about a lot of things,

especially that whole ( … )in' Diamond--
that Lester Diamond incident.

All of a sudden, you're the shoulder
to cry on?

Did you her tell about your little role
in that whole situation?

No, I didn't. What good would that do?
That's not the point.

The point is that she's upset,
and you've got a ( … )in' problem.

I would appreciate it if you stay out
of my personal life, okay?

You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
She came to talk to me.

She came to talk to me.
What was I supposed to do, throw her out?

Just stay away from her.
It's none of your business.

It's none of my business?
A week ago it was my business.
Now it's none of my business.

When you need me to take care
of something for you, then you need me.

The way you need me to vouch
for you as a citizen and get
you out of one of your jams.

I'm gonna have to straighten out
what you just did with this guy.

This guy is gonna run to the FBI now.

Your ( … )in' head is gettin'
bigger than your casino.
That's your problem, pal.

[ Ace ] I knew what he wanted,
and I didn't want any part of it.

Nicky wanted to take over.

He wanted to go after Gaggi,
go after the skim,

go after everything and everybody.

Plus he had stopped
asking permission from back home
for every little thing.

[ Gunshot ]

A casino boss and his wife were killed.

The bulls questioned Nicky.

A dealer from the Sirocco.
They questioned Nicky.

A bunch of stool pigeons
wound up in the trunks of their cars.

They questioned Nicky.

A lawyer.

They questioned Nicky.

And when some guys
who didn't pay their shylocks
began disappearing,

Nicky's name was in every one
of those newspapers.

Nicky was questioned
in two dozen murders,

but they always had to let him go.

There were never any witnesses.

[ Nicky ] The coppers
blamed me for everything
that went wrong out here.

I mean every ( … )in' little thing.

Watch yourself. You're gonna get
runned over there.

If a guy ( … )in' tripped
over a ( … )in' banana peel,
they'd bring me in for it.

That's enough. Be nice, huh? Be nice.

And the bosses were no better.

They complained day and night
because things don't run smooth.

Well, in my line of work,
things don't run so smooth. I'm sorry.

I mean, I'm dealin' with
degenerate animals out here.

But the bosses,
what do they give a ( … )?

They're sittin' on their ( … )es
drinkin' anisette.

Meanwhile, I'm the guy in the trenches.

( … )in' bosses, they think
it's a ( … )in' free lunch out here.

Frankie, they found
a guy's head in the desert.
You know about that?

Yeah, I heard. Yeah. Yeah.

Everybody's talkin' about it.
They're makin' a big deal out of it.

- It's in all the papers.
- What are you gonna do?

I mean, that's no good. I know.

You gotta tell him
to take care of things a little better.

I'll tell him, Remo.

[ Nicky ] ( … )in' bosses.
They're smokin' their De Nobilis,

and they're eatin' trippa
and ( … )in' soffritto--
fried pigs' guts.

While if I want to talk private,
I gotta go to a bus stop.

What do they care as long
as I keep sendin' money back?

Yeah, but they're complainin'.

Let 'em complain.
I'm the one who's here.
I do all the work.

Somebody don't like it, ( … ) 'em.

It's up to you.

They want a ( … )in' war? I'm ready.

All I gotta do is
take care of four or five
of those ( … )in' guys.

The rest will fall right into place.
Believe me.

Peekaboo, you ( … )s, you.

I see you, you mother( … )ers.

[ Ace ] The problem was,

Nicky was not only
bringing heat on himself, but on me too.

The FBI watched every move he made,
but he didn't care.

He just didn't care.

[ Nicky ] If they're gonna watch me,
I'm gonna watch 'em right back.

I spent a few bucks. Top dollar.
Who gives a ( … )?

I got the latest anti-buggin' equipment

from the same places
that sell to the ( … )in' CIA.

I had all the special
police frequency radios,
FBI descramblers,

cameras that see in the dark.

And because of that, the miserable
sons of ( … )es that they are,

they never once caught me doin' anything
I couldn't handle.

[ Ace ] I got my job on the line,

and this guy's out havin'
the time of his life.

He has every cop
in the state watchin' him,
and he's out playin' golf.

[ Chattering ]

And at the worst possible time for me.

I had my license hearing coming up,

and I didn't wanna leave
anything to chance.

They were simple gambling pinches.

If I can't work in Vegas,
where am I gonna go?

You've been very open with us.
I mean, your books and papers.

That's gonna mean something
when you go before the commission.

That's all I ask, gentlemen,
is a fair hearing.

This kind of honesty will
guarantee that fair hearing.

Good. All right. We'll move on to--

[ Airplane Engine Sputtering ]

I wanted to hear something
about Kansas City.

[ Sputtering Continues ]
What the ( … ) is this?

Where's this ( … )in' guy gonna land,
in the fairway?

They're ( … )in' agents, Frankie. Look at this.

The feds were watching Nicky
play golf for so long,
they ran out of gas.

Just what I needed, right in front
of the Control Board.

Hundred dollars, whoever hits the plane.

And as if things weren't bad enough,

in comes Piscano,
the Kansas City underboss.

He ran that little grocery
store in Kansas City where
they brought the suitcases.

They're fightin' over those suitcases again.
You know what that means, right?

I got to take another trip
to Vegas. It's gonna cost me
another couple of grand.

He ran it with his
brother-in-law, but mostly
what he did was complain.

He complained about
his trips to Vegas to his
brother-in-law and his mother.

You gotta lay down the law.
Otherwise, they're gonna make
a fool out of you.

They can't make
a fool out of me. I write it
all down in this book.

Every ( … )in' nickel
goes down right here. Receipts--

Hey, oh-- What's the matter with you?
Everything's here.

Since when do you talk like that?
I'm sorry.

Nance gives me trouble,
and I'll tell him

screw around with those
suitcases and I'll take the eyes
out of his frickin' head.

Again.

I didn't curse. I said frickin' head.

That's enough.
I'm sorry.

[ Ace ] What happens next?
You can't believe it.

Who would believe that
the FBI had a wire in the place

lookin' for some information
about some old homicide

about some guy who was
whacked out God knows when
over God knows what.

What's to prevent him with
the suitcases that he could take what he wants?

( … )in' Nance brings us
back two suitcases from the Tangiers.

What about three or four?

We've got nobody in the room to watch.
That's the law.

We can't even go into the count room to watch our money.

Could you believe this cowboy bull( … )?

And sure, he's got his people in there.
But how do you know?

They could all be in on it together,
those miserable ( … )s.

I'll find out. If it's Green himself,
I'll bury that bastard.

I never trusted him.
And you know I got eyes behind my head.

They trust that ( … )bag. I don't.

Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit
the two of them in the head with a ( … )in' shovel.

[ Piscano's Mother ] Easy.
[ Piscano ] Ma, I'm sorry. They're
beatin' me left and right.

Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
I know, but that's enough.

You know what they're doin'.
I can't take this no more. Back and forth. Back and forth.

Take it easy. You could get
a heart attack like that.
I know. I'm too upset.

An end has to be put to this.

[ Ace ] And the ( … ) thing is
they hear all this stuff about Las Vegas
and the casinos and suitcases,

and that's it.

[ Piscano ] ...and start kickin' ( … ).
I'll do it.

And I'll use the god( … ) shovels.

Everything's comin' outta my pocket.
I gotta pay for all this ( … ).

[ Ace ] Would you believe that
such a thing could happen?

[ Piscano ] I'm in this to make money,
not to lose money!

[ Ace ] Every FBI man across the country
had their ears open now.

[ Piscano ]
If you want something done right
you gotta do it yourself.

[ Ace ] I mean, Piscano, this guy
basically sunk the whole world.

[ Piscano's Mother ]
There are some that are good
and some that are bad.

[ Man ] Mr. Chairman,
members of the commission,

Mr. Rothstein is pleased
to be here today.

[ Ace ] When the day finally came,
I was ready.

I felt so confident that all I had to do
was present my case.

And we have documents,
one of which is a report
by retired FBI agents,

which completely absolves Mr. Rothstein
from any wrongdoing.

- Counselor, before you continue--
- I want to have this marked--

This commission is prepared
to act on a motion denying
the Rothstein application.

- Denying?
- Do I hear a motion seconded?

Mr. Chairman, I second the motion.

Do I have a vote on the motion?

Aye. Aye. Aye.

- The ayes have it.
This hearing is adjourned.
- You guys have to be kidding.

Adjourned?
What do you mean, "adjourned"?

Mr. Chairman. Senator,
you promised me a hearing.

You won't allow me a hearing.
You didn't even look at the FBI reports.

When you were my guest,
Mr. Chairman, Senator,
at the Tangiers Hotel,

did you not promise me that I would have
a fair hearing?

I was never your guest.
You were never my guest? I never comped you?

I don't comp you at least
two or three times a month at the Tangiers?

I'd like to answer that at this time.

Mr. Rothstein is being
very typical to this point. He's lying.

The only time I was at the Tangiers

was when I had dinner
with Barney Greenstein.

Was I at that dinner?
Tell me, was I at the dinner?
You were wandering around.

Was I at that dinner? Was I?
You were wandering around.

You were... in the--
You were in the building.
I was in the building?

You know ( … ) well I was at that dinner,

and you swore to me that I would have
a fair hearing at that dinner.

Did you not? Did you not?

Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner.
Allow me that much.

Give me that much at least.
Yes, you were.

Thanks for not calling me
a liar, you son of a ( … ).
You son of a--

Good evening, everyone.
I'm Paige Novodor.

A routine licensing hearing
turned into bedlam yesterday

when the flamboyant
Tangiers casino executive,
Sam "Ace" Rothstein,

what are you runnin' for, Bob?
accused the state's top
gaming officials of corruption.

You promised me when you were
getting comped at my hotel.

You were asking me for copies
of your bill so you could
put 'em on your expense account.

In a wild and unprecedented
outburst that followed
his gaming license denial...

- Bull( … )! Bull( … )!
- ...Rothstein followed several

stunned commissioners
into the hallway where
he continued his harangue

until his own lawyers
and friends urged him to leave.

You have a past. I have a past.
My past is no worse than yours.

But you guys think you have
the right to pass judgment.

Long suspected of running the Tangiers
without a gaming license,

yesterday's hearing was
to determine whether someone
with Rothstein's history

was qualified to officially hold
a top gaming post.

[ Ace ] ( … )in' hypocrites!

What the hell's he gonna do now?
I don't know.

What's he doin'? He knows
all those guys he yelled at
are friends of ours.

What's the matter with him,
making all this mess?

Maybe he could run things
with another job title.

It won't be the best.
But what are we gonna do?

However he runs things,
it's gotta be quiet. Let him
hide upstairs in the office.

Say he's a janitor. I don't give a ( … ).

But, please, whatever job he takes,
make sure it's something quiet.

♪♪ [ "Flight Of The Bumblebee" ]

Oh, no, no. Oh, no.

Oh, Jesus.

He's juggling.

[ Ace ] Let's not
take County Commissioner
Pat Webb too seriously.

I recently challenged him
to a debate on this program,
and he declined.

What are you worried about, Pat?

You don't have to send me any questions.

You can ask me anything you want.

[ Stone ] What the hell is he doin'
on television anyway?

He's on all night, screamin'
about how he's gonna take
his ( … ) lawsuit

all the way to the Supreme Court.

He really must be crazy.
He's gonna go to Washington with this?

He's out of his ( … )in' mind.

It's a pity in this state
that we have such hypocrisy.

Some people can do whatever they want.

Other people have to pay
through the nose. But such is life.

Andy, go see him.
Tell him maybe it's time he should quit.

[ Ace ] First of all, what they did was
totally unconstitutional.

We're on the list to be heard
before the Supreme Court
of the United States.

These guys back home don't give
a ( … ) about the Supreme Court
and any of this bull( … ).

They want things to quiet down.
They want you to walk away.

Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious.

How can I walk away? Don't you see
what's going on here?

Don't you see what's at stake?

The old man said maybe
your friend should give in.

When the old man says "maybe,"
that's like a papal bull.

Not only should you quit,
you should run.
You know what my problem is?

Every time they mention
my name in the papers,

these ( … )suckers,
they mention Nicky too.

How the ( … ) does that help?

The heat he brought down is murder.

The police department was cooperative.

He pissed 'em off so much now
that nobody can make a move anymore.

What do you do about that?
What are you proposing?

I don't know. He doesn't listen to me.

Maybe he should get lost for a while,
take a vacation.

Would that be so bad?
They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.

Look, if he took a break,
it would give everybody
some time to maneuver.

That's all that I'm saying.
I would forget about the maneuver.

I would just get out.

[ Sighs ]

I can't do that.

[ Ace ] Of course as soon
as Andy got back home,

Nicky heard about our talk in the car.

Next morning, bright and early,
I get the call.

Great. You know,
I've got to do some shopping
afterwards. You want to go?

[ Ace ] Just getting a call
from Nicky wasn't easy anymore.

Even the codes didn't work.
So we figured out another act.

If a phone's tapped,
the feds can only listen in
on the stuff involving crimes.

So on routine calls,
they have to click off
after a few minutes.

[ Woman ] Yeah, I got a sprained
( … )in' elbow.

- Yeah.
- Meet me at 3:00.

- At Caesar's?
- 100 yards further down the road.

- Why?
- Don't ask questions. Just be there.

Suzy Creamcheese has
the exact same outfit.

[ Laughs ] I saw something.

Something very cute.

[ FBI Agent ] Okay, he's out.
It's the ant. Brown unit.

And he's with the bogey.
I think it's Frankie.

[ Ace ] Nicky started out before me

because it wasn't that easy
for him to get around anymore.

Nicky couldn't even go for a ride

without changing cars at least six times

before he could shake all his tails.

Because of the planes, he had
to use underground garages.

It's a scary place.

I knew about the holes
in the desert, of course.

And everywhere I looked,
there could have been a hole.

Normally, my prospects
of comin' back alive

from a meetin' with Nicky
were 99 out of 100.

But this time, when I heard
him say a couple of hundred
yards down the road,

I gave myself 50-50.

Where the ( … ) you get off
talkin' to people about me

behind my back, goin' over my head?

What people?

What people? What'd you think,
I wasn't gonna find out?

I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.

No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?

I gotta listen to people
because of your ( … )in' ( … )?

You're orderin' me out?
You better get your own
( … )in' army, pal!

I didn't order you or anybody.
I only told Andy Stone that you had
heat on you, and that was a problem.

You want me to get out
of my own ( … )in' town?

Yeah. I said, "L-L-Let
the bull( … ) blow over for
a while so I can run the casino."

Anything goes wrong
with the casino, it's my ass.
It's not yours-- it's my ass.

Well, I don't know
whether you know this or not,

but you only have your ( … )in' casino
because I made that possible!

I'm what counts out here,
not your ( … )in' country clubs
or your ( … )in' TV shows!

And what the ( … )
are you doin' on TV anyhow?!

You know I get calls
from back home every ( … )in' day?
They think you went bat( … )!

I'm only on TV because
I gotta be able to hang around
the casino. You understand that--

Your ( … )in' ass!

You could have had the food-and-beverage job
without goin' on television!

You wanted to go on TV!

Yeah, I did want to go on TV.
That way I have a forum.

I can fight back. I'm known. People see me.

They know they can't ( … ) around
with me like they could if I was
an unknown. That's right. Yeah.

You're makin' a big
( … )in' spectacle of yourself.

Me? I wouldn't even be in this situation
if it wasn't for you.

You brought down so much ( … )in' heat on me.

I mean, every time I meet somebody,
the big question is: Do I know you?

Oh, sure, now you want to blame
your ( … )in' license on me. Is that it?

No, I'm just-- Nicky, when you asked me
if you could come out here, what did I tell you?

I mean, you asked me, and I knew
you were gonna come out no matter what I said.

But did I tell you?
Do you remember what I told you?

Back-- B-Back up a ( … )in'
minute here. One minute!

I asked you?
When the ( … ) did I ever ask you
if I could come out here?

Get this through your head--

You never--

Get this through your head,
you j( … )w mother( … )er, you!

You only exist out here because of me!
That's the only reason.

Without me, you personally--

Every ( … )in' wiseguy
still around will take a piece
of your ( … )in' j( … )w ass!

Then where you gonna go?
You're ( … )in' warned.

Don't ever go
over my ( … )in' head again,
you mother( … )er, you!

The little guy. He's half in the bag,

and nobody told him he was
86ed from the joint.

So we all turned our heads
and made out like
we didn't know who he was.

He's over at the 21 table
with his nose wide open.

He took money out
of his own kick. His nose
is open for about 10,000.

- Now he's really pissed.
- Oh, no.

- He wants a 50,000 marker.
- Just give him 10.

That's it. Ten. I'll be right down.

He's gonna come up with 10,000,
just the way you want it.

- [ Nicky ] Sue me, you J( … )w ( … ).
- Let's get outta here.

What, get outta here?
I got a marker comin'. Deal.

[ Oscar ] But everything's changed now.
You're talking about a divorce.

You're even asking for alimony
payments and child support,
and now custody.

I just want what any
divorced woman would get.

She's only sober about two hours a day.

It's usually from 11:00
in the morning till 1:00
in the afternoon.

If I gave her her money
and her jewels, you know
what she's gonna do.

She's gonna piss it
all away in about a year.

And then where would she be?
Where would you be then?

Comin' right back to me,
right back to me,

or findin' some other
excuse to come-- I-- I--

We had a deal.

Remember that?

He said if it didn't work out
between us, I could get
my things, and I could leave.

Look in my eyes.

Look-- Look in my eyes.

You know me.

Do you see anything in these eyes

that makes you think I would ever let
someone in your condition

take my child away from me?

Do you?

You know that won't happen.

[ Ace ] And after all this time

and as hard as I tried,
as much as I wanted,

I could never reach her.

I could never make her love me.

I always felt she should have gone
for all that money,

being somebody for the first time
in her life,

a home, a kid.

That's not what happened.
It just didn't work out that way.

Everything all right?
I mean, what could we do?

After a while, we'd just take
breathers from each other.
Little separations.

At that time, I remember Ginger
took Amy and went to Beverly Hills.

She was gonna spend
a week or so shopping.

[ Woman ] Yes, Mr. Rothstein.
Operator, the Beverly Hotel
in Beverly Hills, please.

[ Operator ] Hello. Beverly Hotel.

[ Ace ] Mrs. Sam Rothstein, please.

I'm sorry. Mr. And Mrs. Rothstein

Hey. Little Dale Evans.

Yes, they both checked out. Thank you.

[ Handset Settles In Cradle ]

[ Phone Ringing ]

Hello. Yeah.

My wife is with an old friend
of hers in L.A.

Some lowlife.
A guy named Lester Diamond.

My daughter is with them too,
and I think they're gonna try
and kidnap her.

- Is there anybody you can send?
- We'll take care of it.

[ Doorbell Rings ]

We got a number and an address.

Hello.
[ Lester ] Hello.

Yeah, is this Lester?

Who's calling?

This is Sam Rothstein.
I wanna talk to Ginger.
Put her on the phone.

She's not here, Sam.

Lester, listen to me very carefully.
I want to talk to Ginger.

I want my kid back.
I want her put on a plane immediately.

I know she's there. Don't ( … ) around.
Sam, I wouldn't.

[ Lester Snaps Fingers ]
You shouldn't do this.

- [ Snapping Fingers ]
- [ Ace ] You understand?
Put her on the ( … )in' phone.

Sam, I don't know where she is, okay?

So-- L-L-L-Listen-- I'll tell y--

Can I call you back in a few minutes?

702-472-1862. Mm-hmm. 1862.

Okay, I'll call you right back.
Right away.

- Right back.
- You got it.

Schmuck. All right, I just bought us
a few minutes.

You wanna get back at this prick? Hmm?

Okay, you got what,
$2 million in that box? [ Snorts ]

Hey, you got a minute?
He's got two million
in the box, am I right?

You let him keep your jewels.

We take the cash and the only
other thing he cares about.
Huh? Her Majesty.

We go to Europe. You dye your hair.

I don't want to go to Europe.
I want to go to see The Elephant Man.

We're not gonna see
any ( … )in' elephants, okay?
We're going to Europe.

Let the adults talk. You dye your hair.

You get plastic surgery
like we talked about.

You're the mother.
How much you think he's
gonna pay to get this kid back?

I don't want to go to Europe.
Shut your mouth. You know
where she gets this from?

You shut up.
[ Lester ] You want me to come over there?

I'll smack your face. Don't give me any
of your ( … )!

Okay, this has always been a dream,
but now we're going.

Lester, he called you here.
He called you right here.
That's who was on the phone.

- I just talked to him.
- So he knows where you are.

That means he's sending
some guys over here, probably right now.

Ginger, it means he's sitting
by the phone, like a dumbbell,

waiting for me to call him back.
He's sitting by the phone
just waiting for you to call.

What do you think we're
gonna do? He's probably got
guys outside the ( … )in' house!

- This is ( … )in' bull( … )!
This is bull( … )!
- Get your bag! Let's go!

Oh, what bull( … )? What?
You want to talk it over now?

Okay, you done yakkin'?

Go, go! Get in the car! Go, go, go.

Just relax. Nobody's killing anybody.

[ Ginger ] I think he's gonna kill me.
Just relax.

Call me back here in exactly
an hour on this phone.

I'll see what I can do.

I'm gonna call you back
in an hour at this number,

and you're gonna be there, right?

I'll be here.

Listen, don't do
anything else crazy, okay?
You all right? Okay.

Bye.

Just knock it off. You two knock it off.
She started it.

She started the whole thing.
I'm just standing here. Get in the car.

You're not gonna drive.
Don't even think you're gonna drive.
I'm gonna drive.

I'm not gonna drive
with some crazy woman.
You're driving me nuts!

Do you think if, uh--
Do you think if I came back,

do you think you could forgive me?

[ Sighs ] I don't know.
I gotta tell you, I don't know.

I understand that.

I know I ( … )ed up.

What about the money? Where's the box?

I gotta tell ya,

I made some mistakes,
and I spent some money.

What's it under? Pretty serious.

It's under 25.

It's under 25,000? Yeah.

The rest of the two million is still there?
Yeah, I got the rest.

Okay, no big deal. That's okay.

He got his 25.

That I'll live with.
Any more, I couldn't.

Okay.

All right, all right.
Where are you? I'll send
a plane for you right away.

Hi, Sam.

[ Ace Grunting ]

So what'd you do with it?

With what? Wi--

With the money.

He needed some clothes.

25,000 for clothes?

He wanted a watch too.

25,000 for clothes and a watch?

Mm-hmm.

Mm-hmm.

[ Man ] Good evening, señora. This way.
Geno.

[ Ace ] The good part was
I had Amy back.

So we went home,
had the housekeeper stay over,
put the kid to bed.

I calmed myself down,
and we went to dinner.

I tried to keep things nice and civil,

but, hey, 25,000 for three suits?

That doesn't make much sense.

First of all, he's not gonna wear
thousand-dollar suits.

Let's say he did, which he won't.

How you gonna get fitted
for 25 suits in three days?

How could you get fitted that fast?

I can't get fitted that fast,
and I pay twice as much.

I bought him a watch too. Yeah.

But even if you bought him a watch,

a really nice watch, one that he thought
was nice--

He doesn't know what the ( … )
a good watch is.

Say you go five, 10, 12 grand...

Yeah.

At the most, which is impossible,
for him.

Plus, at the most,
three suits, 1,000 apiece.
That still leaves what?

Around 10,000?
Would you knock it off, Sam?

I'm just trying to figure it out.
There's nothing to figure out.

I'm home. We're working it out.

I've been told before,
"We're working it out."

You think that you're home,

after what you just
put me through with Amy,
is a favor to me?

So, counting the watch,
let's say another 4,000

for expenses over the weekend,

of which you must have had a good time.

I know he did. That's for sure.

I know that ( … )in' piece of ( … ) had
a good ( … )in' time.

On my money.

You might as well have
( … )ed him, which you
probably did anyway.

You're lookin' at me a certain way.

You're teary-eyed, huh?

You're upset. You're a good actress,
you know that?

Good ( … )in' actress.

You can ( … )in' get
that pity out of people.

You always thought I was, but I'm not.
And I'm not a sucker.

He's lucky I didn't kill him last time.

Lucky he's ( … )in' livin'.

If you would have stayed with Amy

and you would have ran away,
he would have been ( … )in' dead.

Both of you. Dead. Dead.

[ Ginger Whispering ] I can't ( … )in'
live like this.

No, it isn't right. It isn't fair.

We--

Of course. Yes.

He doesn't come home at night.
What is the big ( … )in' deal?

I go-- Listen, I just
can't ( … )in' take it.

Why should I ( … )in' take it?
That wasn't the deal.

He acts like I'm the only one
around here with a ( … )in' past.

He'll never let me live it down.

Well, yes, I have tried.

What the ( … ) do you think
I came back here for?

Just get out of here.

Fine.

You're not taking Amy.

that, I didn't want her to go.

I loved her.

And later, I realized I didn't want
to give her the money,

because if I did,
I knew I'd never see her again.

Nothing. What were you gonna say?

I don't-- Tell me what
you were gonna say.

Yeah? Yeah.

I was thinking maybe you know somebody
at the bank

who could help me get my jewelry out?

There's a lot of money in there.

I'd be willing to take care of anybody
who helped me out.

Let me think about that. Okay.

Let me see who I got in there.
Gotta get somebody I can trust,
you know?

You know he's never gonna
give me my jewelry. Hmm.

He holds that key so tight,
he's probably got it stuck up his ass.

[ Laughing ] You're right. That's Sammy.

And he's probably got it there too.

[ Laughs ]

He's so ( … )in' lucky.
I could have buried him.

I could have gone to Europe
and taken the baby.

Then he'd have tracked me down,
and he'd have killed me.
No, he wouldn't.

I would have. [ Laughs ]

He'd have been right too. Seriously.
Come on.

You don't take a guy's kid
and then take off.

I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I
did exactly what you told me
to do, and I came back.

You did. You're right.
You did. I like that.
Exactly what you said.

That's what I like about you.
You did the right thing.
I did what you told me to.

Yes, you did. Because you always tell me
the right thing to do.

Yeah.

He really ( … )ed himself up
out here, didn't he?

He sure did. Everything went
to his head.

[ Sighs ] Changed. Changed.

He did. He ain't the same person, right?
No, he's not.

He really thinks who the ( … ) he is.
Exactly.

He hates me.

Come on, come on. You're a toughie.
You can take this.

Don't cry. I'm not as tough
as you think I am.

Yes, you are.

I'm not, and he scares
the ( … ) out of me.

I never know what he's gonna do.
Come on.

Don't be scared. I need some help. I do.

I need some help.

You gotta help me.

I need a new sponsor, Nicky.

I do. I need a new sponsor.

Is that what you want? Yeah.

A sponsor? Yeah.

Okay.

Don't worry about it.

Nobody will ( … ) with you anymore.

I'll take care of you. Yes, I will.

Who were you with?

I was with somebody.

I know you were with somebody.
Who was it?

I just hope it's not someone who
I think it might be.

[ Sighs ] I just hope it's not that.

[ Ace ] I knew she ( … )ed around.

She did what she did,
and I did what I had to do,

but, Jesus, Nicky was the worst thing
she could have done.

What if he won't stop?

It could get us both killed.

I can back him off.

She was very convincing
when she wanted to be.

And this is how she backed him off.

[ Panting ]

Hey, Ginger.

Don't forget. If you're challenged,

if he asks anything, deny everything.

You understand? I don't want him
bringing beefs back home.

That could really cause
a serious problem.

Got to be careful.
He's not dumb, you know?

You hear what I'm saying, right?

I know. You don't have to tell me that.

What, do you think I'm stupid?

Do I think you're stupid? No.

I think you're beautiful.
But I gotta go.

[ Ace ] By this time, Nicky had things
so ( … )ed up on the streets,

that every time Marino went back home,

the packages got smaller and smaller.

It got to the point,
when he walked into the place,

he didn't know whether he was
going to be kissed or killed.

[ Gaggi ] Frankie, I want
to ask you something.

It's private.

But I want you to tell me the truth.

Of course, Remo.

I want you to tell me
the truth, mind you.

I always tell you the truth, Remo.

Frankie, the little guy,

he wouldn't be ( … )ing
the Jew's wife, would he?

Because if he is, it's a problem.

[ Frankie ] What could I say?

I knew if I gave the wrong answer,

I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace,
all of them could have
wound up gettin' killed.

Because there's one thing
about these old-timers.

They don't like any ( … )ing around
with the other guys' wives.

It's bad for business.

So I lied, even though I knew
that by lying to Gaggi,

I could wind up gettin' killed too.

No, I ain't seen anything like that.

Are you sure?

I'm positive.

Remo, things are very
( … )ed up down there, you know?

Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking.

You see, my main concern is Nicky.
Mm-hmm.

I want to know if he's
doing all right, if he's okay.

He's good. He's fine.

I'm asking you, Frankie,
to keep an eye on Nicky.

Do it for me. No problem.

You see, I wouldn't want
to be jeopardizing anything

for people who are our friends.

You understand? I understand.

Okay.

Frankie, you're a good boy.
Thanks, Remo.

[ Ace ] By now, Nicky and his crew
had already hit rock bottom.

I mean, Vegas really got to him.

The booze, the coke, the broads.

I mean, he got sloppy.

He just wasn't the same Nicky anymore.

You must have drank too much.
Go ( … ) yourself.

I heard one night he had
to belt a guy three times

before the guy finally went down.

In the old days, Nicky would have
decked him with one shot.

You add this into the mix--

Maybe just Vegas got to all of us.

His crew followed him
right over the edge.

They were all tuned up
half the time on coke.

They started doing stupid things.
The worst was Blue.

- Hey, what do you guys
want out of my life, huh?
- Police! Stay in the car!

He never knew when
to keep his mouth shut.

- [ Officer ] Drop the gun!
- ( … ) you!

Drop it!

The cops shot him. They shot Blue

because they thought
his hero sandwich was a gun.

[ Gunshots ]

They could have been right,
but who knows? Jesus Christ!

What gun? He's got a ( … )in'
hero sandwich here.

What do you want?
It's pitch black out here. Pitch black?

It's tinfoil. It looked like a gun!
You ( … )in' moron!

I'll be fillin' out paperwork
for the next two months!
What are we gonna do?

I'm sorry! You ( … )in' jerk-off!

To make matters worse,
to get even, Nicky's crew
got stoned one night,

and they started shooting up
the cops' houses.

It got to the point
where they couldn't even talk
in the Gold Rush anymore,

because the feds put a wire in the wall.

Even when they talked outside,
they had to cover
their mouths because...

( … ), he's covering up again.

...the feds brought in lip readers.

Nicky found out about it from a teller
who owed him money.

He asked me again about you
and the Jew's wife.

Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?

He asked me again about you
and the Jew's wife.

Yeah? What'd you tell him?

I told him I didn't know nothin'.

But Jiggs and Tony Gorilla
said if you did anything,
you're ( … )ed up.

You think he's going home
making a beef behind my back?

Nah. You would have heard something.

What's to stop him? I know. I know.

I don't trust him anymore,
but they'd never
okay anything, you know.

Yeah, but they keep asking about it.

Sure they're asking.
They earn with the prick.

I got a funny feeling
he's gonna start a ( … )in' war
or something.

I'm not sure yet, but you know what
I want you to do?

Who's this guy? Who's this guy?

That ain't nobody.

You know what I want you to do?

Get a couple of guys to dig a hole
in the desert,

then let them show you where it's at.

Angelo and Buster.
Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.

They'll do it. When I'm ready,
I'll say the word.

Go see the Jew,
and you make it disappear.
You know what I mean?

Yeah, just let me know.
But you got to be ready.

You know what I'm talkin' about?

Did I say to do anything yet?

I said I'm not sure. I'll let you know.
I want to think about it.

Where are these pricks at?
Dominick said they're in the motel?

That or in the ( … )in' bank.
I don't know. Roll over the Jew.

Mr. Rothstein--
Mr. Rothstein, I'm sorry.

We've been getting some
complaints about the noise.

I'm trying to get in my house.
He won't let me in. I understand.

I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy.
I'm not gonna let her in.

I'm not gonna let her in
the way she's behaving.
Not gonna let me in?

Who knows what you're gonna do in there.
What am I gonna do?

I've been in the same
clothes for two days!

I want to get a few
of my things! Big deal! Okay.

How about if we just
let her in the house
to get a few of her things?

This is half her house anyway.
I'm afraid to let her in the house.

[ Ginger ] You aren't afraid, you ( … )er!

I'm afraid she'll destroy stuff.

Let me in the house!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

- ( … )er! ( … )er!
- [ Officer ] Hold on! Hey! Please!

You ought to be afraid,
the way you ( … )in' treat me!

It'll make it
a lot easier on everybody--
If we let her get her things,

we'll be out of your hair.
If she calms down, I will
let her in the house--

- [ Ginger ] I am calm!
- If she calms down,

I will let her in the house
for five minutes

if you gentlemen
will escort her out if she
happens to not want to leave.

Can I go in? Can I go in?
That's not a problem.

Jeff, would you go in with her? Yes.
Yes. Fine! ( … ) you!

[ Shutter Clicking ]

You wouldn't believe how mean
he's been to me. He's locked up
most of my important stuff.

All my papers and things--
I have to get them.
So don't let him come up here.

I know they're in here
in the desk-- ( … ).

Just pay attention.
He could come up here at anytime.

Are you watching for him?

Got 'em.

I don't want her in there more than
a few more minutes.

No, it'll just be a couple--
We got other things to do too.

I'll hurry her up.

How's everything else besides this?
Fine. Fine.

How's your family?
Not bad. Not bad. In fact,
my wife's pregnant again.

Oh, good. Congratulations. Thanks. Yeah.

We're kind of happy about that.

I just have to get this one more thing
and then we can go.

( … ). ( … ).

( … ). God.

Oh, that pisses me off.
Don't worry about it.

[ Footsteps ]

And it would be great

if you guys could just
follow me out of here,

because he's been threatening me.

Take care, Randy. Thank you.

[ Crying ] I can't believe this.

I just need to pick up
a little cash inside.
Could you come with me?

[ Shutter Clicking ]

Char-- You've got to stop her.
You've got to stop her.

I'm sorry, Sam. What can I do?
She's a ( … )in' junkie.
She's out of her ( … )ing mind.

She has the keys.
It's still in both your names.

Oh!

I can do. I'd like to help, but I can't
Legally, she can't take that stuff.

There's nothing I can do.

Um, I'm gonna need a bag.
If you could just ask
the guy for the big bag.

Go get a bag, man. Here, here.

No, you can. You can.
You've been so nice to me.

- Yes, just hold the top open.
All right? And I can--

Oh, God, it's him. You have to stop him.

He said he was gonna
kill me. You should-- Just stop him.

Mr. Roth-- Mr. Roth-- Mr. Rothstein,
wait a minute.

Hold on a second. Hey. [ Engine Starts ]

[ Ace ] She's driving away.
[ Randy ] There's nothing we can do.

There's nothing we can do.
Look, look, look.

You can't stop her for speeding?
Look what she's doing.

There's nothing we can do.
She had the keys. She's on the account.

Let's pull her over
at that Citgo station.
Okay. Let's do it.

[ Siren Wailing ]

We're placing you under arrest for--
For what?

We're placing you under arrest
for aiding and abetting. For what?

We're placing you under arrest
for aiding and abetting.
But I'm just trying to leave.

[ Ace ] After all the threats
and all the bull( … ),

it turned out Ginger
didn't tell them anything.

But, by then, the feds
didn't need her anyway.
But it was just mine.

They had all the pieces they needed.

Everybody began to tumble,
one after the other.

FBI! We have a warrant!

Just like dominoes.

Between Piscano complaining on the wire,

between Nicky, Ginger,
me and my license--

Paradise. We managed
to really ( … ) it all up.

[ Doorbell Rings ]

Mom.

Yeah, someone's at the ( … )in' door now.

FBI. We have a federal search warrant.

[ Nicky ] I got wind of the pinches
coming down, so I took off.

Who needs to hang around
for that bull( … )?

My name is Mark Casper,
special agent, FBI.

Yeah?

Can I make a ( … )in' phone call?
Hey, hold it a minute.

You can make a phone call,
but you don't have
to talk to us like that.

[ Agent ] Everybody, out of the room.
Over to the alarm.

They got almost everybody else.
[ Agent ] This area is seized.

Get the master account list.
I want all those papers seized
regardless of what they are.

[ Men Chattering ]

Put every box on the table.

Ah, yes. Here we are.
Little craps figures. [ Chuckling ]

[ Ace ] Green? Don't even ask.

$30,000 of yours. No, he didn't. That's
why it wasn't valid.

I was being extorted.
I'm willing to tell you
whatever you want to know.

I've got nothing to hide here.
[ Nicky ] Now for the best.

I couldn't believe this ( … ).
Piscano's expense reports took the cake.

Oh, this is good. Bingo.
He might as well have given them
a ( … )in' blueprint.

Everybody's names, addresses,
dates, everything.

Look at this.
Thank you so much, Mr. Piscano.
How considerate of you.

Those are my mother's books.
You're under arrest.

[ Nicky ] What a ( … )in' balloon head.
What are you guys doing?

Take it easy. [ Groans ] Wait!

Wait a minute. He's sick. Oh, God!
Move back.

I think it's his heart!
Oh, God! Is he breathing? CPR now!

[ Ace ] Poor Artie. He got so upset,
he had a heart attack

and dropped dead right
in front of his wife.

Calm down!

Artie! No, I won't calm down!

He's my husband! Artie! Artie!
We can't help him if--

And at the end of the day,
they finally came to see me
with the pictures.

Why protect a friend
who betrayed you like that?

But I didn't want to look at them.

I didn't want to look
at the guys who brought them either.

♪ There is a house in New Orleans ♪

Your Honor, as you can see,
my clients are elderly and infirm.

Any incarceration could
pose a serious health risk.

[ Nicky ] When the bosses were arrested,
some of them were so old,

they needed doctors
at their arraignment.

[ Lawyer ] Pretrial services
recommends that bail remain
as presently set.

We're going to take a 10-minute recess.

When it looked like they could get
25 years to life in prison

just for skimmin' a casino,
sick or no ( … )in' sick,

you knew people were going
to get clipped.

So the day of the arraignment,
they had this meeting right
in the back of the courthouse.

See, when something like this happens,

you know how things are gonna work out.

It's always better with no witnesses.
So what about Andy?

He won't talk. Stone is a good kid.

Stand-up guy just like his old man.

That's the way I see it.

I agree. He's solid.
He's a ( … )in' marine.

He's okay. He always was.
Remo, what do you think?

Look,

why take a chance?

At least, that's the way
I feel about it.

Call Artie. Tell him, I don't care what,

he's got to be in my office
Thursday morning before 11:00.
It's done.

It's terribly important.
I gotta have a conversation
with that guy--

[ Gun Firing ]

♪ And the only time he's satisfied ♪

[ Nicky ] As much as they liked him,
he wasn't one of us.

He wasn't Italian. As far as they knew,
he could have talked.

Otherwise, Stony might still be alive.

The first one to skip was John Nance.

He found a nice, warm,
secluded place in Costa Rica.

He thought nobody would find him there.
[ Gunshots ]

[ Glass Shatters ]

[ Gunshots, Clattering ]

[ Nicky ] But then his kid got nabbed
by the feds for drugs.

And so, naturally,
the bosses were afraid
he'd come out of hiding

just to save his kid
and give them all up.

No matter what the feds
or the papers might have said
about my car bombing,

it was amateur night, you could tell.

Whoever it was, they put the dynamite
under the passenger side.

But what they didn't know,
what nobody outside the factory knew,

was that that model car
was made with a metal plate
under the driver's seat.

It's the only thing that saved my life.

The bombing was never authorized,

but I suspect I know who lit the fuse.

And so did the powers that be.

[ Nicky ] It took months
for everything to calm down.

But, finally, my guys got out on bail,

and the bosses wanted me
to send my brother Dominick
out to Vegas.

Always the dollars.
Always the ( … )in' dollars.

I mean, it was still way too hot for me
to even go near Vegas.

So I set up a meeting with the guys
way out in the sticks.

I didn't want my brother
to get ( … )ed around.
I mean, what's right is right.

They don't give a ( … ) about-- Argh!

Holy ( … )in'--

What the ( … )--

Come on, mother( … )er!

[ Yelling ] Tough guys!
You and your ( … )in' brother!

- [ Nicky Gagging ]
- You ( … )in' ( … )bags! No more!

- Frankie!
- No more! You see? Watch!

[ Men Shouting ]

Frankie! Frankie! You piece of ( … )!
( … ) you, you mother( … )er!

[ Nicky ] ( … )in' punk, mother( … )er!
Piece of ( … )!

[ Frankie ] No more ( … )in' dirty work!

No, no, no, no!

Take this mother( … )er out!

[ Clubbing Continues ] Oh, Dominick.

Oh, Dom.

Frankie, leave the kid alone.
He's still breathing.

He's still breathing. Leave him alone.
Frankie.

[ Clubbing Stops ]

[ Frankie ] All right. Strip him.

[ Nicky Crying ] No ( … )s.
You got no ( … )in' ( … )s.

Ah, Dominick.

Ah, Dom.

[ Crying ]

[ Nicky ] Dominick. Dominick.

[ Sobbing ] Dominick.

Oh, Dominick.

[ Frankie ] Come on, come on.

Bury them? Bury them.

[ Gasping ]
[ Ace ] The word was out.

The bosses had enough of Nicky.
They had enough.

How much were they gonna take?
So they made an example of him
and his brother.

They buried them while they were still breathing.

Mister, you all right? Watch out!

Mister, you all right? Yeah.

They had other ideas for me.

[ Sirens Blaring ]

[ Chattering ]

[ Fireman ] We need some help over here!

[ Groans ] You sure are lucky, mister.

[ Ace ] The town will never be the same.

After the Tangiers, the big corporations
took it all over.

Today it looks like Disneyland.

♪♪ [ Choir Continues ]

And while the kids
play cardboard pirates,

Mommy and Daddy drop the house payments
and Junior's college money

on the poker slots.

In the old days, dealers knew your name,
what you drank, what you played.

Today, it's like checkin'
into an airport.

And if you order room service,
you're lucky if you get it by Thursday.

Today it's all gone.
You got a whale show up
with four million in a suitcase,

and some 25-year-old hotel
school kid is gonna want
his social security number.

After the Teamsters
got knocked out of the box,

the corporations tore down
practically every one
of the old casinos.

And where did the money
come from to rebuild the pyramids?

Junk bonds.

Still not sure?

[ Bell Ringing ] Probable.
Maybe questionable.

Let me know as soon as you can find out.

But in the end, I wound up
right back where I started.

I could still pick winners,

and I could still
make money for all kinds
of people back home.

And why mess up a good thing?

And that's that.
