Henry: AS FAR BACK AS I CAN REMEMBER,

I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE A GANGSTER.

TO ME, BEING A GANGSTER

WAS BETTER THAN BEING PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.

EVEN BEFORE I FIRST
WANDERED INTO THE CAB STAND

FOR AN AFTER-SCHOOL JOB,

I KNEW I WANTED TO BE A PART OF THEM.

IT WAS THERE THAT I KNEW
THAT I BELONGED.

TO ME IT MEANT BEING SOMEBODY

IN A NEIGHBORHOOD
THAT WAS FULL OF NOBODIES.

THEY WEREN'T LIKE ANYBODY ELSE.

THEY DID WHATEVER THEY WANTED.

THEY DOUBLE-PARKED
IN FRONT OF A HYDRANT.

NOBODY EVER GAVE THEM A TICKET.

IN THE SUMMER WHEN THEY
PLAYED CARDS ALL NIGHT,

NOBODY EVER CALLED THE COPS.

TUDDY CICERO.

COULD THIS BE THE CANARSIE KID?

TUDDY.

MINGHIA, TUDDY.

TUDDY RAN THE CAB STAND

AND THE BELLA VISTA PIZZERIA

AND A FEW OTHER PLACES
FOR HIS BROTHER PAUL

WHO WAS THE BOSS OVER EVERYBODY
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

HELLO, PAULIE.

PAULIE MIGHT HAVE MOVED SLOW...

BUT IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE PAULIE

DIDN'T HAVE TO MOVE FOR ANYBODY.

♪ MUST I FOREVER BE A BEGGAR? ♪

IT'S YOUR FAULT.

YOU STARTED IT.

I STARTED IT?

HEY, JUNIOR, HERE.

AT FIRST MY PARENTS LOVED THAT
I FOUND A JOB

ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE HOUSE.

MY FATHER, WHO WAS IRISH,

WAS SENT TO WORK AT THE AGE OF 11.

HE LIKED THAT I GOT MYSELF A JOB.

HE ALWAYS USED TO SAY AMERICAN
KIDS WERE SPOILED LAZY.

BYE, DAD.

BYE. TAKE YOUR LUNCH.

SEE YOU, MIKEY.

BYE, HENRY.

HENRY, WATCH HOW YOU CROSS!

AND BRING BACK MILK!

MY MOTHER WAS HAPPY AFTER
SHE FOUND OUT THAT THE CICEROS

CAME FROM THE SAME PART
OF SICILY AS SHE DID.

TO MY MOTHER, THAT WAS
THE ANSWER TO ALL HER PRAYERS.

♪ WHOA-O-O-OH ♪

I WAS THE LUCKIEST KID IN THE WORLD.

I COULD GO ANYWHERE, DO ANYTHING.

I KNEW EVERYBODY, AND EVERYBODY KNEW ME.

WISEGUYS WOULD PULL UP,

AND TUDDY WOULD TOSS ME THEIR KEYS

AND LET ME PARK THEIR CADILLACS.

HERE I AM, THIS LITTLE KID.

I CAN'T SEE OVER THE STEERING WHEEL,

AND I'M PARKING CADILLACS.

♪ CAN'T WE BE SWEETHEARTS? ♪

♪ WHY DON'T WE FALL IN LOVE? ♪

BUT IT WASN'T TOO LONG BEFORE
MY PARENTS CHANGED THEIR MINDS

ABOUT MY JOB AT THE CAB STAND.

THIS IS FOR YOUR MOTHER AND SISTER.

FOR THEM, THE CAB STAND WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE A PART-TIME JOB.

BUT FOR ME, IT WAS DEFINITELY FULL-TIME.

THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO DO.

SEE, PEOPLE LIKE MY FATHER
COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND,

BUT I WAS A PART OF SOMETHING.

I BELONGED.
I WAS TREATED LIKE A GROWN-UP.

TELL HIM 519.

EVERY DAY, I WAS LEARNING TO SCORE.

A DOLLAR HERE, A DOLLAR THERE.

I WAS LIVING IN A FANTASY.

Man: ( … ) HIS MOTHER AND HIS FATHER.

DID YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY AT SCHOOL?

MY FATHER WAS ALWAYS PISSED OFF.

HE WAS PISSED THAT HE MADE LOUSY MONEY,

HE WAS PISSED
THAT MY KID BROTHER MICHAEL

WAS IN A WHEELCHAIR, HE WAS PISSED

THAT THERE WERE 7 OF US
LIVING IN A TINY HOUSE.

TELL ME ABOUT THIS.

IT'S A LETTER FROM SCHOOL.

IT SAYS YOU HAVEN'T

BEEN THERE IN MONTHS.

IN MONTHS!

YOU THINK YOU'RE SO SMART?

YOU WANT TO GROW UP TO BE A BUM?

BUT AFTER A WHILE, HE WAS MOSTLY PISSED

BECAUSE I HUNG AROUND THE CAB STAND.

HE KNEW WHAT WENT ON AT THAT CAB STAND,

AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,
I'D HAVE TO TAKE A BEATING.

BUT BY THEN I DIDN'T CARE.

THE WAY I SAW IT,

EVERYBODY TAKES A BEATING SOMETIME.

DON'T!

I CAN'T MAKE ANY DELIVERIES.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU'LL ( … ) EVERYTHING UP.

MY DAD SAYS HE'S GONNA KILL ME. LOOK.

COME ON WITH ME.

IS THAT HIM THERE, KID?

NO.

HOW ABOUT HIM?

NOPE.

THAT'S THE GUY.

GET HIM.

EXCUSE ME.

YEAH?

HEY! HEY! HEY!

IF ANOTHER LETTER FROM THAT SCHOOL

GOES TO THAT KID'S HOUSE,

IN THE ( … )IN' OVEN YOU'RE GONNA GO!

THAT WAS IT. NO MORE LETTERS

FROM TRUANT OFFICERS,
NO MORE LETTERS FROM SCHOOL.

IN FACT, NO MORE LETTERS FROM ANYBODY.

FINALLY, MY MOTHER HAD TO GO
THE POST OFFICE AND COMPLAIN.

HOW COULD I GO BACK TO SCHOOL AFTER THAT

AND PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG

AND SIT THROUGH
GOOD GOVERNMENT BULL( … )?

♪ WILL NEVER BREAK ME ♪

PAULIE HATED PHONES.

HE WOULDN'T HAVE ONE IN HIS HOUSE.

MIKEY CALLED. WANT ME TO CALL HIM BACK?

MAKE THE CALL. GO AHEAD.

HE USED TO GET ALL HIS CALLS SECONDHAND.

THEN YOU'D CALL THE PEOPLE BACK
FROM AN OUTSIDE PHONE.

GOT A NICKEL? GET HIM ON THE PHONE.

THERE WERE GUYS, THAT'S ALL THEY DID,

ALL DAY LONG, WAS TAKE CARE
OF PAULIE'S PHONE CALLS.

YEAH, YEAH.

ALL RIGHT, RIGHT.

JUST LIKE THIS.

WHAT A DOG.

FOR A GUY WHO MOVED ALL DAY LONG,

PAULIE DIDN'T TALK TO 6 PEOPLE.

IF THERE WAS A UNION PROBLEM
OR, SAY, A BEEF IN THE NUMBERS,

ONLY THE TOP GUYS CAN MEET
WITH PAULIE TO DISCUSS IT.

EVERYTHING WAS ONE-ON-ONE.
PAULIE HATED CONFERENCES.

HE DIDN'T WANT
ANYBODY HEARING WHAT HE SAID,

AND HE DIDN'T WANT ANYBODY
LISTENING TO WHAT HE WAS TOLD.

HUNDREDS OF GUYS DEPENDED ON PAULIE.

HE GOT A PIECE OF EVERYTHING THEY MADE.

IT WAS TRIBUTE LIKE IN THE OLD COUNTRY

EXCEPT THEY WERE DOING IT
HERE IN AMERICA.

ALL THEY GOT FROM PAULIE

WAS PROTECTION FROM OTHER GUYS
LOOKING TO RIP THEM OFF.

THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.

THAT'S WHAT THE FBI
COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND,

THAT WHAT PAULIE
AND THE ORGANIZATION DOES

IS OFFER PROTECTION FOR PEOPLE
WHO CAN'T GO TO THE COPS.

THAT'S IT. THAT'S ALL IT IS.

THEY'RE LIKE THE POLICE
DEPARTMENT FOR WISEGUYS.

[CRASH]

PEOPLE LOOKED AT ME DIFFERENTLY.

THEY KNEW I WAS WITH SOMEBODY.

I DIDN'T HAVE TO
WAIT IN LINE AT THE BAKERY

ON SUNDAY MORNINGS ANYMORE
FOR FRESH BREAD.

THE OWNER KNEW WHO I WAS WITH

AND HE'D COME FROM AROUND THE COUNTER.

NO MATTER HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE WAITING,

I WAS TAKEN CARE OF FIRST.

OUR NEIGHBORS DIDN'T PARK
IN OUR DRIVEWAY ANYMORE,

EVEN THOUGH WE DIDN'T HAVE A CAR.

AT 13, I WAS MAKING MORE MONEY
THAN MOST OF THE GROWN-UPS.

I HAD MORE MONEY THAN I
COULD SPEND. I HAD IT ALL.

ONE DAY...

ONE DAY, SOME OF THE KIDS
FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD

CARRIED MY MOTHER'S GROCERIES
ALL THE WAY HOME.

YOU KNOW WHY? IT WAS OUT OF RESPECT.

HI, MOM. WHAT DO YOU THINK?

LOOK AT MY SHOES. AREN'T THEY GREAT?

MY GOD, YOU LOOK LIKE A GANGSTER.

THEY SHOT ME! HELP!

[ITALIAN OPERA PLAYING]

HENRY, SHUT THE DOOR!

THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME
I HAD EVER SEEN ANYONE SHOT.

JESUS! CAN'T HAVE THAT IN HERE.

JESUS CHRIST, I CAN'T
HAVE THAT IN THIS JOINT.

I REMEMBER FEELING BAD ABOUT THE GUY,

BUT I ALSO REMEMBER FEELING
THAT MAYBE TUDDY WAS RIGHT.

I KNEW PAULIE DIDN'T WANT
ANYBODY DYING IN THE BUILDING.

YOU'RE A REAL JERK.

YOU WASTED 8 ( … )IN' APRONS
ON THIS GUY.

WHAT THE HELL'S WRONG WITH YOU?
I GOT TO TOUGHEN THIS KID UP.

DECIDED TO TAKE ON A BOSS

IT WAS WHEN I MET THE WORLD.

IT WAS WHEN I FIRST MET JIMMY CONWAY.

HE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
MORE THAN 28 OR 29 AT THE TIME,

BUT HE WAS ALREADY A LEGEND.

HE'D WALK IN THE DOOR,

AND EVERYBODY WHO WORKED
THE ROOM JUST WENT WILD.

HE'D GIVE THE DOORMAN A HUNDRED
JUST FOR OPENING THE DOOR.

HE'D SHOVE HUNDREDS
IN THE POCKETS OF THE DEALERS

JIMMY, I'D LIKE YOU

HOW YOU DOING? PLEASURE.

THANK YOU.

KEEP IT COMING.

JIMMY WAS ONE OF THE MOST
FEARED GUYS IN THE CITY.

HE WAS FIRST LOCKED UP AT 11,

AND HE WAS DOING HITS
FOR MOB BOSSES WHEN HE WAS 16.

HITS NEVER BOTHERED JIMMY.
IT WAS BUSINESS.

BUT WHAT JIMMY REALLY LOVED TO DO...

WHAT HE REALLY LOVED TO DO WAS STEAL.

I MEAN, HE ACTUALLY ENJOYED IT.

JIMMY WAS THE KIND OF GUY

WHO ROOTED FOR THE BAD GUYS
IN THE MOVIES.

GIVE ME YOUR WALLET.

YOU MIGHT KNOW WHO WE ARE,
BUT WE KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

HE WAS ONE OF
THE CITY'S BIGGEST HIJACKERS

OF BOOZE, CIGARETTES, RAZOR BLADES,

SHRIMP, AND LOBSTERS.

SHRIMP AND LOBSTERS WERE BEST.
THEY WENT REALLY FAST.

ALMOST ALL OF THEM WERE GIMMIES.

THEY GAVE IT UP, NO PROBLEM.

THEY CALLED HIM JIMMY THE GENT.

TOMMY, HELP THE LADY.

THE DRIVERS LOVED HIM.

THEY'D TIP HIM OFF
ABOUT REALLY GOOD LOADS,

AND EVERYBODY GOT A PIECE.

THANKS, JIMMY.
I'LL BE BACK WITH THE REST LATER.

SEE YOU LATER.

HENRY, COME HERE.

SAY HELLO TO TOMMY.

YOUSE'RE GONNA BE WORKING TOGETHER, OK?

OK. SOUNDS GOOD.

HEY, JIMMY, YOU GOT ANYTHING GOOD?

AND WHEN THE COPS
ASSIGNED AN ARMY TO STOP JIMMY,

WHAT DID HE DO?

HOW YOUSE DOIN'?

HE MADE THEM PARTNERS.

JIMMY, I'D COMPLAIN, BUT WHO'D LISTEN?

GIVE ME ONE PALL MALL.

I'LL TAKE 2 LUCKIES.

2 LUCKIES. HERE YOU GO.

THANKS.

ONE PALL MALL.

THERE WAS 30 BILLION A YEAR IN CARGO

MOVING THROUGH IDLEWILD
AIRPORT, AND BELIEVE ME,

WE TRIED TO STEAL EVERY BIT OF IT.

YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND,

WE GREW UP NEAR THE AIRPORT.
IT BELONGED TO PAULIE.

WE HAD FRIENDS AND RELATIVES
WHO WORKED ALL OVER THE PLACE,

AND THEY WOULD TIP US OFF

ABOUT WHAT WAS COMING IN AND MOVING OUT.

IF ANY TRUCKERS OR AIRLINES
GAVE US ANY TROUBLE,

PAULIE HAD HIS UNION PEOPLE
SCARE THEM WITH A STRIKE.

IT WAS BEAUTIFUL, AN EVEN
BIGGER MONEYMAKER THAN NUMBERS,

AND JIMMY WAS IN CHARGE OF IT ALL.

WHENEVER WE NEEDED MONEY,
WE'D ROB THE AIRPORT.

I KNOW YOU'RE HIS FRIEND.

I'M BEGGING YOU. WHAT CAN I SAY?

WHAT DOES HE WANT FROM ME?

I DON'T KNOW NOTHING

ABOUT THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS, NOTHING.

ALL I KNOW IS HOW TO SIT DOWN AND ORDER.

I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE A RESTAURANT.

NOT FOR YOU. JUST A PLACE TO HANG.

THE CHEF IS GREAT.

THIS IS NOT EVEN FAIR.

YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

YOU RUN THE JOINT.

MAYBE I'LL TRY TO HELP YOU.

GOD BLESS YOU, PAULIE. I APPRECIATE IT.

NOW THE GUY'S GOT PAULIE AS A PARTNER.

ANY PROBLEMS-- HE GOES TO PAULIE.

TROUBLE WITH A BILL--
HE CAN GO TO PAULIE.

TROUBLE WITH THE COPS,
DELIVERIES, TOMMY--

HE CAN CALL PAULIE.

NOW THE GUY'S GOT TO COME UP
WITH PAULIE'S MONEY EVERY WEEK,

NO MATTER WHAT. BUSINESS BAD?
( … ) YOU. PAY ME.

OH, YOU HAD A FIRE? ( … ) YOU. PAY ME.

PLACE GOT HIT BY LIGHTNING?
( … ) YOU. PAY ME.

MIND IF I GET ONE OF THOSE TVs?

ALSO, PAULIE COULD DO ANYTHING,

ESPECIALLY RUN UP BILLS
ON THE JOINT'S CREDIT.

WHY NOT? NOBODY'S
GONNA PAY FOR IT, ANYWAY.

AS SOON AS THE DELIVERIES
ARE MADE IN THE FRONT DOOR,

YOU MOVE THE STUFF OUT THE BACK
AND SELL IT AT A DISCOUNT.

YOU TAKE A $200 CASE OF BOOZE
AND SELL IT FOR 100.

DOESN'T MATTER. IT'S ALL PROFIT.

AND THEN FINALLY,
WHEN THERE'S NOTHING LEFT...

AND YOU CAN'T BORROW
ANOTHER BUCK FROM THE BANK

OR BUY ANOTHER CASE OF BOOZE,

YOU BUST THE JOINT OUT.
YOU LIGHT A MATCH.

I'M TRYING TO BANG THIS ( … )IN'
BROAD. YOU WANNA HELP ME OUT?

I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU!

WHAT? HER ( … )IN' FAMILY
LIVES IN THE FIVE TOWERS.

THESE JEW BROADS GOT A LOT OF MONEY.

YOU'LL WIND UP
WITH A BIG ( … )IN' SCORE,

YOU MOTHER( … )ER!

OH, ( … )! SEE? YOU
WITH YOUR ( … )IN' MOUTH!

ME?

I HAD A MEETING WITH TUDDY AROUND 11:00,

AND HERE I AM, A BACKUP GUY FOR TOMMY.

HONEY, YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT?

YEAH, I'M JUST WATCHING MY DIET.

LET ME WATCH YOUR FIGURE FOR YOU.

I COULDN'T WAIT TO GET AWAY.

I WAS ORDERING DESSERT
WHEN THEY WERE EATING DINNER.

WHEN THEY WERE HAVING COFFEE,
I WAS ASKING FOR A CHECK.

I HAD BUSINESS.

HAVE SOME COFFEE. IT'LL WAKE YOU UP.

JOE, CAN WE HAVE THE CHECK?

WHOA, WHOA, WHERE'RE YOU GOING?

I GOTTA GO.

GO WHERE? WE JUST GOT HERE.

I GOT THAT THING. I GOT TO GO.

WAIT A COUPLE MINUTES.
WE'LL ALL LEAVE TOGETHER.

THIS WAY YOU DON'T GO OUT LIKE HOBOS,

STAGGERING OUT ONE AT A TIME.

Girl: I COULDN'T STAND HIM.

I THOUGHT HE WAS REALLY OBNOXIOUS.

HE KEPT FIDGETING AROUND.

YOU DON'T MIND, DO YOU?

THAT'S VERY ANNOYING.

IT'S ANISETTE.

GOOD, HUH?

YOU'D PROBABLY DO BETTER
WITH MANISCHEVITZ,

BUT IT WOULD LOOK FUNNY ON MY TABLE.

READY?

HENRY, LIGHTEN UP.

WE JUST GOT HERE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

Girl: BEFORE IT WAS
EVEN TIME TO GO HOME,

HE WAS PUSHING ME INTO THE CAR
AND THEN PULLING ME OUT.

IT WAS RIDICULOUS.

DIANE AND TOMMY MADE US PROMISE
TO MEET THEM FRIDAY NIGHT.

WE AGREED.

OF COURSE, WHEN FRIDAY NIGHT
CAME, HENRY STOOD ME UP.

I FEEL TERRIBLE.

I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS.

HE REALLY LIKED YOU, TOO.

WE WERE A TRIO INSTEAD OF A DOUBLE DATE.

I HOPE IT'S NOTHING SERIOUS.

THAT'S WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

BUT I MADE TOMMY
TAKE ME LOOKING FOR HIM.

[TIRES SCREECHING]

TOMMY, WHAT THE ( … )?

YOU GOT SOME NERVE, STANDING ME UP.

NOBODY DOES THAT TO ME.

WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

FRANKIE VALLI OR SOME BIG SHOT?

TAKE IT EASY! SLOW DOWN, ALL RIGHT?

I FORGOT! I THOUGHT IT WAS NEXT WEEK.

IT WAS THIS FRIDAY, AND YOU AGREED,

SO YOU'RE A LIAR!

WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS. TAKE IT EASY.

TALK TO YOU AFTER WHAT YOU JUST DID?

FORGET IT. I'M NOT TALKING TO
YOU ABOUT ANYTHING.

I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA STAND ME UP.

YOU LOOKED BORED.
YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? HMM?
LET ME MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

Henry: SHE'S SCREAMING
ON THE STREET, I MEAN LOUD,

BUT SHE LOOKED GOOD.

IT'LL COST YOU A LOT.

SHE HAD THESE GREAT EYES,
JUST LIKE LIZ TAYLOR'S.

AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

HELLO, HENRY.

YOU READY? YEAH.

OH, NO. WAIT A MINUTE.

QUICK, YOU HAVE TO COVER THAT CROSS.

MY MOTHER SEES THAT CROSS...

KAREN?

MOM.

I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET HENRY HILL.

HOW DO YOU DO?

HI. NICE TO MEET YOU.

MY DAUGHTER SAYS
THAT YOU'RE HALF JEWISH.

IT'S JUST THE GOOD HALF.

HA HA!

THANK YOU, SIR.

I'LL SEE YOU LATER. THANKS.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING, LEAVING YOUR CAR?

HE WATCHES THE CAR FOR ME.

IT'S EASIER THAN LEAVING IT AT A GARAGE.

WE WEREN'T MARRIED TO 9:00-TO-5:00 GUYS,

WAS WHEN MICKEY HAD A HOSTESS PARTY.

LAWRENCE.

LAWRENCE. OUT ON THE

I'M FROM MIAMI. YOU EVER BEEN THERE?

IT'S OK, BUT IT'S LIKE YOU DIED

HE PULLS OUT A GUN.

YOU AUTOMATICALLY MAKE
THEM OUT TO BE SAINTS.

THEY LOOKED BEAT UP.

WAS THROWN TOGETHER AND CHEAP--

A LOT OF PANTSUITS AND DOUBLE-KNITS.

THE WOMAN IS NO ANGEL, BELIEVE ME.

THEY TALKED ABOUT
HOW ROTTEN THEIR KIDS WERE

AND ABOUT BEATING THEM
WITH BROOM HANDLES

AND LEATHER BELTS,

BUT THAT THE KIDS STILL
DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION.

WHEN HENRY PICKED ME UP, I WAS DIZZY.

I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD LIVE LIKE THAT!

IF YOU WENT TO PRISON?

MICKEY SAID THAT JEANNIE'S HUSBAND--

YOU KNOW WHY HE'S IN THE CAN?
BECAUSE OF JEANNIE!

BECAUSE HE WANTED TO GET AWAY FROM HER.

LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

NOBODY GOES TO JAIL UNLESS THEY WANT TO.

UNLESS THEY MAKE THEMSELVES GET CAUGHT.

THEY DON'T HAVE THINGS ORGANIZED.

I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE HIM.

GO INSIDE. MAKE YOURSELVES COMFORTABLE.

NO, NO, NO. GO TO SLEEP.

NO. I CAN'T SLEEP, NOT WHILE HE'S HOME.

I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM IN SO LONG.

I WANT TO SEE HIM. YOUSE GO INSIDE.

THIS STUFF IS GREAT, BUT IT'S LIKE LEAD.

SO, TELL ME. WHERE YOU BEEN?

I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU,

YOU HAVEN'T EVEN CALLED OR ANYTHING.

WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

MA, I'VE BEEN WORKING NIGHTS.

AND?

AND TONIGHT WE WERE OUT LATE,

WE TOOK A RIDE OUT TO THE COUNTRY,

AND WE HIT ONE OF THOSE DEERS.

THAT'S WHERE ALL THE BLOOD CAME FROM.

JIMMY TOLD YOU BEFORE.

THAT REMINDS ME, MA, I NEED THIS KNIFE.

I'M GONNA TAKE THIS. IT'S OK?

OK. BRING IT BACK, THOUGH, YOU KNOW.

THE POOR THING.

WE HIT THE DEER IN HIS PAW.

WHAT DO YOU CALL IT?

THE PAW.

THE HOOF.

THE HOOF GOT CAUGHT IN THE GRILL.

I GOTTA HACK IT OFF.

OOH!

HEY, MA, IT'S A SIN.
YOU GONNA LEAVE IT THERE?

ANYWAY, I'LL BRING YOU BACK YOUR KNIFE.

DELICIOUS. DELICIOUS.

THANK YOU.

WHY DON'T YOU GET YOURSELF A NICE GIRL?

I GET A NICE ONE ALMOST EVERY NIGHT.

YEAH, BUT GET YOURSELF A GIRL

SO YOU CAN SETTLE DOWN.

I SETTLE DOWN ALMOST EVERY NIGHT,

BUT THEN IN THE MORNING, I'M FREE.

I LOVE YOU, MA. I WANNA BE WITH YOU.

WHY DON'T YOU SETTLE DOWN?

Mother: HOW'S YOUR FRIEND HENRY THERE?

HENRY, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

YOU DON'T TALK TOO MUCH.

Jimmy: YOU SHOULD TALK A LITTLE BIT.

Mother: YOU DON'T EAT MUCH.
YOU DON'T TALK MUCH.

I'M JUST LISTENING.

Mother: YOU REMIND ME
OF WHEN WE WERE KIDS,

THE COMPARIS USED TO VISIT ONE ANOTHER.

THERE WAS THIS MAN. HE WOULD NEVER TALK.

HE WOULD JUST SIT THERE ALL NIGHT

AND NOT SAY A WORD.

THEY SAYS TO HIM, "WHAT'S THE MATTER?

DON'T YOU TALK? DON'T YOU SAY ANYTHING?"

HE SAYS, "WHAT AM I GONNA SAY?

THAT MY WIFE TWO-TIMES ME?"

SO SHE SAYS TO HIM,

"SHUT UP! YOU'RE ALWAYS TALKING."

HA HA HA!

BUT IN ITALIAN, IT SOUNDS MUCH NICER.

[SPEAKING ITALIAN] THAT'S IT.

WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

IT MEANS HE'S CONTENT TO BE A JERK.

HE DOESN'T CARE WHO KNOWS IT.

DID TOMMY EVER TELL YOU
ABOUT MY PAINTING?

NO.

LOOK AT THIS.

AH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

Tommy: I LIKE THIS ONE.
ONE DOG GOES ONE WAY,

AND THE OTHER DOG GOES THE OTHER WAY.

ONE IS GOIN' EAST,

AND THE OTHER ONE
IS GOIN' WEST. SO WHAT?

AND THIS GUY'S SAYING,
"WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?"

HE'S GOT A NICE HEAD OF WHITE HAIR.

LOOK HOW BEAUTIFUL--
THE DOG. IT LOOKS THE SAME.

IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY WE KNOW.

HA HA HA!

WITHOUT THE BEARD. NO. IT'S HIM.

OH! HA HA HA!

IT'S HIM! HA HA HA!

[THUMPING]

[THUMP]

[THUMP]

WHAT THE ( … ) IS THAT?

FOR MOST OF THE GUYS,
KILLINGS GOT TO BE ACCEPTED.

MURDER WAS THE ONLY WAY
THAT EVERYBODY STAYED IN LINE.

YOU GOT OUT OF LINE, YOU GOT WHACKED.

EVERYBODY KNEW THE RULES.

BUT SOMETIMES EVEN IF PEOPLE

DIDN'T GET OUT OF LINE,
THEY GOT WHACKED.

HITS JUST BECAME A HABIT
FOR SOME OF THE GUYS.

GUYS WOULD GET INTO ARGUMENTS
OVER NOTHING,

AND BEFORE YOU KNEW IT,
ONE OF THEM WAS DEAD.

AND THEY WERE SHOOTING
EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME.

SHOOTING PEOPLE WAS A NORMAL THING.

IT WAS NO BIG DEAL.

WE HAD A SERIOUS PROBLEM
WITH BILLY BATTS.

THIS WAS REALLY A TOUCHY THING.

TOMMY HAD KILLED A MADE GUY.

BATTS WAS PART OF THE GAMBINO CREW

AND WAS CONSIDERED UNTOUCHABLE.

BEFORE YOU COULD TOUCH A MADE GUY,

YOU HAD TO HAVE A GOOD REASON.

YOU HAD TO HAVE A SIT-DOWN,
AND YOU BETTER GET AN OK,

OR YOU'D BE THE ONE WHO GOT WHACKED.

HEY, FRANKIE. HOW ARE YOU?

VITO. HEY.

HEY, HOW ARE YA, BUDDY?

SATURDAY NIGHT WAS FOR WIVES,

BUT FRIDAY NIGHT AT THE COPA
WAS ALWAYS FOR THE GIRLFRIENDS.

[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

AND LAST WEEK WE SAW SAMMY DAVIS JR.

YOU GOT TO SEE THIS SHOW.

WHAT A PERFORMER.
HE DOES THESE IMPERSONATIONS.

I SWEAR, YOU'D THINK
IT WAS THE REAL PEOPLE.

IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

I MEAN, YOU COULD SEE

HOW A WHITE GIRL CAN FALL FOR HIM.

WHAT?

WELL, NOT ME. I'M JUST SAYING

LIKE YOU COULD SEE HOW SOME GIRLS COULD,

YOU KNOW, LIKE THAT SWEDISH GIRL.

IN OTHER WORDS, YOU CONDONE THAT STUFF?

TAKE IT EASY. HA HA HA!

I DON'T WANT TO WIND UP KISSING

( … )IN' NAT "KING" COLE OVER HERE.

I'M NOT TALKIN' ABOUT ME.
I'M JUST SAYIN'--

HA HA HA!

YOU CAN SEE HOW A GIRL COULD.
HE'S GOT PERSONALITY.

PERSONALITY.

A GUY WITH PERSONALITY.

HE'S VERY TALENTED.

I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING,

BUT YOU HAVE TO WATCH OUT SOMETIMES

HOW YOU SAY THINGS.

PEOPLE GET THE WRONG IMPRESSION.

I JUST SAID HE'S TALENTED.
HE'S JUST UNBELIEVABLE.

WHY DON'T YOU JUST LEAVE IT ALONE NOW?

I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU SAID.

THE GUY'S TALENTED.

LEAVE IT AT THAT. HE'S VERY TALENTED.

VERY FUNNY, GUYS.

HERE'S A LEG.

OH, I HIT A SKUNK, KAREN, ALL RIGHT?

GO WITH YOUR MOTHER.

COME ON. EWW! IT'S DISGUSTING, HENRY.

I SET UP JANICE IN AN APARTMENT

AROUND THE CORNER FROM THE SUITE.

THAT WAY, I COULD STAY OVER
A COUPLE NIGHTS A WEEK.

SEE MY NEW ANTIQUE LAMP.

KAREN WAS HOME WITH THE KIDS,

AND SHE NEVER ASKED
ANY QUESTIONS ANYWAY.

IT'S ALL MAURICE VALENCIA.

THIS IS ALL SILK. THIS IS FROM SIAM.

JANICE AND I WERE HAVING SO MUCH FUN,

AND I HAD TO STRAIGHTEN OUT
HER BOSS A LITTLE.

JANICE CAN DO WHATEVER SHE WANTS TO DO!

YOU GOT IT?!

I GOT IT. I GOT IT.

HANG UP ONCE MORE,

AAH!

JUST BE CAREFUL. BABY, BABY, DON'T...

Karen: STILL, I COULDN'T HURT HIM.

HOW COULD I HURT HIM?

I COULDN'T EVEN BRING
MYSELF TO LEAVE HIM.

THE TRUTH WAS THAT
NO MATTER HOW BAD I FELT,

I WAS STILL VERY ATTRACTED TO HIM.

WHY SHOULD I GIVE HIM TO SOMEONE ELSE?

WHY SHOULD SHE WIN?

CHINESE FOOD?

NO. COME ON. SIT DOWN.

[DOOR CLOSES]

KAREN CAME TO THE HOUSE.

SHE'S VERY UPSET.

THIS IS NO GOOD. YOU GOTTA
STRAIGHTEN THIS THING OUT.

WE'VE GOT TO HAVE CALM NOW.

YOU UNDERSTAND? WE DON'T KNOW

WHAT THE HELL SHE'S GONNA DO.

SHE'S GETTING ALL HYSTERICAL.

SHE GETS VERY EXCITED.

SHE'S WILD. AND YOU,

I CAN'T DO IT, HENRY.

IT'S-- I CAN'T DO IT.

NOBODY SAYS YOU CAN'T DO
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

DO WHAT YOU WANNA DO. WE ALL KNOW THAT.

I MEAN, THIS IS WHAT IT IS.

OK? YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS.

YOU HAVE TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

YOU HAVE TO GO HOME TO THE FAMILY,

UNDERSTAND?

YOU GOTTA GO HOME. OK?

LOOK AT ME. YOU GOTTA GO HOME.

SMARTEN UP.

ALL RIGHT?

ALL RIGHT.

I'M GONNA TALK TO KAREN.

I'LL STRAIGHTEN THIS THING OUT.

I KNOW JUST WHAT TO SAY TO HER. OK?

I'M GONNA TELL HER
YOU'RE GOING BACK TO HER.

EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE
JUST THE WAY IT WAS

WHEN YOU WERE FIRST MARRIED.

IT'S GONNA BE ROMANCE.
IT'S GONNA BE BEAUTIFUL.

I KNOW HOW TO TALK TO HER,
ESPECIALLY TO HER.

IN THE MEANTIME, JIMMY AND TOMMY

ARE GOING DOWN TO TAMPA THIS WEEKEND

TO PICK UP SOMETHING FOR ME.

INSTEAD, YOU GO WITH JIMMY.

YOU COME WITH ME.

WE'LL GO DOWN THERE, OK?

HAVE A GOOD TIME.
TAKE SOME TIME FOR YOURSELF.

RELAX. SIT IN THE SUN.
TAKE A COUPLE OF DAYS OFF.

ENJOY YOURSELVES.

WHEN YOU COME BACK,
YOU'LL GO BACK TO KAREN, HUH?

PLEASE, THERE'S NO OTHER WAY.

YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET A DIVORCE.

WE'RE NOT ANIMALE.

NOT GONNA GET A DIVORCE.

SHE'LL NEVER DIVORCE HIM.

SHE'LL KILL HIM,

BUT SHE WON'T DIVORCE HIM.

Paulie: YEAH. YEAH.

YOU GONNA PAY IT?

I AIN'T GOT IT, I SWEAR.

HUH? YOU GONNA PAY?

JUST GIVE US THE ( … )ING MONEY!

I CAN'T. I CAN'T. I SWEAR.

LET'S GO. LET'S GO.

COME ON, WE'LL THROW THE BASTARD

TO THE LIONS.

NO! NO!

I AIN'T GOING NEAR ANY LIONS!

JUST THROW HIM OVER THE MOAT.

NO! I'LL GET THE MONEY! I'LL GET IT!

THEY MUST REALLY FEED EACH OTHER

TO THE LIONS DOWN THERE,

BECAUSE THE GUY GAVE THE MONEY RIGHT UP.

I SWEAR TO CHRIST I'LL GET THE MONEY!

WE GOT TO SPEND THE REST OF
THE WEEKEND AT THE TRACK.

YEAH. THEY MEAN BUSINESS.

THEN I COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED.

WHEN WE GOT HOME,

WE WERE ALL OVER THE NEWSPAPER.

AT FIRST, I DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW WHY WE GOT PICKED UP.

THEN I FOUND OUT THE GUY WE ROUGHED UP

TURNED OUT TO HAVE A SISTER

WORKING AS A TYPIST FOR THE FBI.

WHO COULD BELIEVE IT?
OF ALL THE ( … )ING PEOPLE!

SHE GAVE UP EVERYBODY--
JIMMY, ME, EVEN HER BROTHER.

IT TOOK THE JURY 6 HOURS
TO BRING US IN GUILTY.

THE JUDGE GAVE JIMMY AND ME 10 YEARS

LIKE HE WAS GIVING AWAY CANDY.

...10 YEARS IN A FEDERAL PENITENTIARY.

YOU WILL NOW BE TURNED OVER

TO THE UNITED STATES
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE.

WELL, SWEET HENRY. TOAST, GUYS.

GOOD TRIP. GOOD LIFE. GET OUT SOON.

GOOD TRIP, SWEETHEART.

SALUTE. SALUTE.

ALL THE BEST.

WE'LL WATCH THE HOME FRONT

FOR YOU.

[SPEAKING ITALIAN]

SAY HELLO TO THOSE
( … ) JOB HACKS, HUH?

DON'T FORGET--

MOTHER( … ) THEM
EVERY CHANCE YOU GET, HUH?

HA HA HA!

I'LL CALL YOU, UH, WHEN I GET A CHANCE.

NOW TAKE ME TO JAIL.

IN PRISON, DINNER
WAS ALWAYS A BIG THING.

WE HAD A PASTA COURSE,
AND THEN WE HAD MEAT OR FISH.

PAULIE DID THE PREP WORK.

HE WAS DOING A YEAR FOR CONTEMPT,

AND HE HAD THIS WONDERFUL
SYSTEM FOR DOING THE GARLIC.

HE USED A RAZOR AND
HE USED TO SLICE IT SO THIN

THAT IT LIQUEFIED IN A PAN
WITH JUST A LITTLE OIL.

IT WAS A VERY GOOD SYSTEM.

VINNIE WAS IN CHARGE
OF THE TOMATO SAUCE.

AHH! GOT 3 KINDS OF MEAT
IN THE MEATBALLS.

YOU GOT VEAL, BEEF, AND PORK.

AH, GOOD. YOU GOTTA HAVE THE PORK.

AH, THAT'S THE FLAVOR.

I FELT HE USED TOO MANY ONIONS,

BUT IT WAS STILL A VERY GOOD SAUCE.

DON'T PUT TOO MANY ONIONS IN THE SAUCE.

I DIDN'T PUT TOO MUCH ONIONS, PAUL.

3 SMALL ONIONS, THAT'S ALL I DID.

3 ONIONS?

HOW MANY CANS OF TOMATOES?

I PUT 2 CANS, 2 BIG CANS.

JOHNNY DIO DID THE MEAT.

WE DIDN'T HAVE A BROILER,

SO JOHNNY DID EVERYTHING IN PANS.

IT USED TO SMELL UP
THE JOINT SOMETHING AWFUL,

AND THE HACKS USED TO DIE,

BUT HE STILL COOKED A GREAT STEAK.

HEY, HOW DO YOU LIKE YOURS?

RARE. MEDIUM RARE.

MEDIUM RARE? HMM, AN ARISTOCRAT.

YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU THINK OF PRISON...

HERE'S YOUR LOBSTERS.

YOU GET PICTURES IN YOUR MIND
OF ALL THOSE OLD MOVIES

WITH ROWS AND ROWS OF GUYS BEHIND BARS.

BUT IT WASN'T LIKE THAT FOR WISEGUYS.

IT REALLY WASN'T THAT BAD,

EXCEPTING I MISSED JIMMY.

HE WAS DOING HIS TIME IN ATLANTA.

Johnny: GIVE ME 2 STEAKS
WHILE YOU'RE IN THERE.

EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE JOINT
WAS DOING REAL TIME,

ALL MIXED TOGETHER, LIVING LIKE PIGS.

BUT WE LIVED ALONE.

I MEAN, WE OWNED THE JOINT.

...BASEBALL-BATTED THEM TWO
TILL YOU COULDN'T RECOGNIZE 'EM.

EVEN THE HACKS WE COULDN'T BRIBE

WOULD NEVER RAT ON THE GUYS THAT WE DID.

PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD HAD RESPECT.

PEOPLE LOVED ONE ANOTHER.
YOU LEFT YOUR DOORS OPEN.

SORRY IT TOOK SO LONG.
THAT SKINNY GUARD'S

GETTING TO BE A REAL PAIN IN THE ( … ).

WE'LL HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.

I TOOK CARE OF HIM.

WHAT DID YOU BRING?

UH, SOME BREAD.

GOOD. FRESH.

VINNIE, I GOT YOUR PEPPERS AND ONIONS.

SALAMI, PROSCIUTTO, A LOT OF CHEESE.

COME ON. WHAT ELSE?

SCOTCH. NICE.

HERE'S SOME RED WINE.

OK. NOW WE CAN EAT.

I GOT SOME WHITE, TOO.

GIMME THE WHITE. BEAUTIFUL.

OK, BOYS. LET'S EAT.

COME ON. IT'S READY, VINNIE.

HERE'S SOME MORE BREAD.

TOMORROW, WE EAT SANDWICHES.

YOU GOTTA GO ON A DIET, VINNIE.

BELIEVE ME.

JOHNNY?

READ 'EM AND WEEP.

[LAUGHTER]

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

[LAUGHTER]

YEAH. I'LL TAKE THAT.

ALL RIGHT. I'LL CATCH YOU GUYS LATER.

YOU GOING FOR A WALK IN THE PARK?

Henry: THERE YOU GO.

OK. I'LL CATCH YOU NEXT WEEK.

THANKS. ALL RIGHT.

ARE THERE ANY MORE?

NO. THAT'S IT.

HAVE A GOOD WEEKEND. THANKS.

THANK YOU, HENRY.

MRS. HILL, COME HERE.

COME ON.

YOU GIRLS STAY RIGHT HERE.

I WANT YOU TO HOLD HANDS.

GO RIGHT UP TO THE FRONT.

TOGETHER. LET'S GO.

HOW ARE YOU DOING?

GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?

VERY WELL, THANK YOU.

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

I SAW HER NAME IN THE REGISTER.

JESUS CHRIST.

YOU WANT HER TO VISIT YOU?

LET HER STAY UP ALL NIGHT CRYING

AND WRITING LETTERS TO THE PAROLE BOARD.

WHAT AM I DOIN' HERE?
WHERE AM I? I'M IN JAIL.

I CAN'T STOP PEOPLE
FROM COMING TO SEE ME.

GOOD. LET HER SNEAK THIS STUFF
IN FOR YOU EVERY WEEK.

LET HER FIGHT WITH THOSE
BASTARDS EVERY WEEK!

LOOK WHAT YOU'RE DOING! STOP IT!

I'M SORRY.

LET HER SNEAK THIS ( … ) IN FOR YOU.

STOP IT! WILL YOU STOP IT, KAREN?

LET HER DO IT!

STOP IT!

[CRYING]

SHH. SHH. RUTH, COME HERE.

NOBODY'S HELPING ME.

I'M ALL ALONE.

BELLE AND MORRIE ARE BROKE.

I ASKED YOUR FRIEND REMO

FOR THE MONEY THAT HE OWES YOU.

YOU KNOW WHAT HE TOLD ME?

HE TOLD ME TO TAKE MY KIDS
DOWN TO THE POLICE STATION

AND GET ON WELFARE.

KAREN, IT'S GONNA BE OK.

EVEN PAULIE, SINCE HE GOT OUT,

I NEVER SEE HIM.

I NEVER SEE ANYBODY ANYMORE.

IT'S ONLY YOU AND ME.

THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GO AWAY.

I'VE TOLD YOU THAT. WE'RE ON OUR OWN.

FORGET EVERYBODY ELSE.

FORGET PAULIE.

AS LONG AS HE'S ON PAROLE

HE DOESN'T WANT ANYBODY DOING ANYTHING.

[CRYING]

SHH, SHH, SHH.

I CAN'T DO IT.

YES, YOU CAN, KAREN. LISTEN TO ME.

ALL I NEED FOR YOU

IS TO KEEP BRINGING ME THIS STUFF.

I GOT A GUY IN HERE FROM PITTSBURGH

WHO'S GONNA HELP ME MOVE IT.

BELIEVE ME, IN A MONTH,

WE'RE GONNA BE FINE.
WE WON'T NEED ANYBODY.

I'M AFRAID.

I'M AFRAID IF PAULIE FINDS OUT.

WHAT'D I JUST SAY?

DON'T WORRY ABOUT HIM.
HE'S NOT HELPING US OUT.

IS HE PUTTING ANY FOOD ON THE TABLE?

WE'VE GOTTA HELP EACH OTHER.

WHILE WE DO IT.

I DON'T WANT TO HEAR A WORD
ABOUT HER ANYMORE, HENRY.

I GOTTA GO TO PITTSBURGH IN THE MORNING.

THOSE GUYS OUT THERE,

WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
I GOT THINGS LINED UP.

PITTSBURGH? YOU HAVE TO GO SEE

YOUR PAROLE OFFICER TOMORROW.

KAREN, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE.

WHO WANTS TO GO TO UNCLE PAULIE'S?

HE DIDN'T DO THE RIGHT THING.

WHAT? WHAT DO YOU WANT?

I DON'T WANT ANY MORE

PAULIE, WHY WOULD I
WANT TO GET INTO THAT?

DON'T MAKE A JERK OUT OF ME.

JUST DON'T DO IT.

JUST DON'T DO IT.

NOW, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT JIMMY.

YOU GOTTA WATCH OUT FOR HIM.

HE'S A GOOD EARNER, BUT HE'S WILD,

TAKES TOO MANY CHANCES.

I KNOW THAT. I KNOW JIMMY.

YOU THINK I'D TAKE CHANCES LIKE JIMMY?

AND TOMMY, HE'S A GOOD KID, TOO,

BUT HE'S CRAZY, HE'S A COWBOY.

HE'S GOT TOO MUCH TO PROVE.

YOU GOTTA WATCH OUT FOR KIDS LIKE THIS.

I ONLY USE THEM FOR CERTAIN THINGS.

I AIN'T GONNA GET ( … )ED LIKE GRIBBS,

IT'S A LICENSE TO DO ANYTHING.

BUONA FORTUNA, TOMMY.

THANKS. HOW MANY YEARS AGO

WAS YOUSE MADE?

I'M AN OLD-TIMER. 30 YEARS AGO.

30 YEARS, HUH?

BRINGS BACK A LOT OF MEMORIES.

AND HOW.

PIKES PEAK WAS A PIMPLE THEN,

WASN'T IT? HA HA HA.

AS FAR AS JIMMY WAS CONCERNED,

WITH TOMMY BEING MADE,

IT WAS LIKE WE WERE ALL BEING MADE.

WE WOULD NOW HAVE
ONE OF OUR OWN AS A MEMBER.

OH, NO.

[GUNSHOT]

YEAH.

YEAH.

WHO'S THIS?

THIS IS VINNIE.

VINNIE, WHAT HAPPENED?

DID EVERYTHING GET STRAIGHTENED OUT?

NO, WE HAD A PROBLEM.

WE TRIED TO DO EVERYTHING WE COULD.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. HE'S GONE,

AND WE COULDN'T DO NOTHING ABOUT IT.

THAT'S IT.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

HE'S GONE. HE'S GONE.

AND THAT'S IT.

MOTHER( … )ER!

( … )ING--I KNEW IT.

I CAN'T ( … )IN' BELIEVE--

I CAN'T ( … )ING--

[CRYING]

THE ( … )--

WHAT HAPPENED?

THEY WHACKED HIM.

THEY ( … )IN' WHACKED HIM.

OH, ( … ).

[CRASH]

[CRYING]

IT WAS REVENGE FOR BILLY BATTS

AND A LOT OF OTHER THINGS.

AND THAT'S THAT.

AND THERE WAS NOTHING
WE COULD DO ABOUT IT.

BATTS WAS A MADE MAN, AND TOMMY WASN'T.

WE HAD TO SIT STILL AND TAKE IT,

'CAUSE AMONG THE ITALIANS,
IT WAS REAL GREASEBALL ( … ).

THEY EVEN SHOT TOMMY IN THE FACE

SO HIS MOTHER COULDN'T
GIVE HIM AN OPEN COFFIN

AT THE FUNERAL.

I WAS GOING TO BE BUSY ALL DAY.

I HAD TO DROP OFF SOME GUNS AT JIMMY'S

TO MATCH SOME SILENCERS HE HAD GOTTEN.

I HAD TO PICK UP MY BROTHER
AT THE HOSPITAL

AND DRIVE HIM BACK TO THE HOUSE
FOR DINNER THAT NIGHT,

AND THEN I HAD TO PICK UP
SOME NEW PITTSBURGH STUFF

FOR LOIS TO FLY DOWN

NEAR ATLANTA.

THEY DON'T FIT.

WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

YOU WANT ME TO PAY--
I'M NOT PAYING FOR 'EM.

I DIDN'T SAY A THING.

JIMMY WAS SO PISSED OFF,
HE DIDN'T EVEN SAY GOOD-BYE.

STOP WITH THOSE ( … )IN' ( … )S.

THEY'RE MAKING YOUR MIND
INTO MUSH, YOU HEAR ME?

I'LL TAKE 'EM BACK.

I KNEW MY PITTSBURGH GUYS
ALWAYS WANTED GUNS,

TO PICK UP A DELIVERY,

I WAS PRETTY SURE I'D GET MY MONEY BACK.

OH, MY GOD.

WHEN I FINALLY GOT THERE AT THE HOSPITAL

TO PICK UP MICHAEL,

HIS DOCTOR WANTED TO PUT ME IN BED.

JESUS CHRIST, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

UH, NOTHING. I JUST ALMOST
GOT INTO AN ACCIDENT.

I TOLD HIM ABOUT THE ACCIDENT,

AND I SAID I WAS PARTYING ALL NIGHT.

COME ON, GET OVER HERE.

LET ME CHECK YOU OUT.

♪ YOU CAN SHAKE ME UP ♪

HE TOOK MERCY ON ME.

HE GAVE ME 10 MILLIGRAMS
OF VALIUM AND SENT ME HOME.

MY PLAN WAS TO DROP OFF
MY BROTHER AT THE HOUSE

AND PICK UP KAREN.

BUNCH OF STUFF I GOTTA DO...

THERE IT IS.

SEE THAT, MICHAEL? SEE THAT HELICOPTER?

WHERE?

I THINK IT'S BEEN FOLLOWING ME

ALL MORNING.

GET THE ( … ) OUTTA--
WHAT ARE YOU, NUTS?

I'M TELLING YOU.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

IT'S THE THIRD TIME I'VE SEEN IT.

I WENT TO THE HOSPITAL,

I STARTED OUT TO GET YOU,

I HAD TO MAKE A COUPLE OF STOPS.

I'VE BEEN ALL OVER TOWN,

AND I'VE SEEN IT ALL DAY.

I WAS COOKING DINNER THAT NIGHT.

I HAD TO START BRAISING
THE BEEF, PORK BUTT,

AND VEAL SHANKS FOR THE TOMATO SAUCE.

I'M GONNA MAKE 'EM ALL.
I'LL MAKE ALL THIS MEAT.

IT WAS MICHAEL'S FAVORITE.

I WAS MAKING ZITI WITH THE MEAT GRAVY,

AND I'M PLANNING TO ROAST SOME PEPPERS

OVER THE FLAMES,

AND I WAS GONNA PUT ON SOME STRING BEANS

WITH SOME OLIVE OIL AND GARLIC.

AND I HAD SOME BEAUTIFUL CUTLETS

THAT WERE CUT JUST RIGHT

THAT I WAS GONNA FRY UP BEFORE DINNER

JUST AS AN APPETIZER.

I WAS HOME FOR ABOUT AN HOUR.

MY PLAN WAS TO START THE DINNER EARLY

SO KAREN AND I COULD UNLOAD THE GUNS

THAT JIMMY DIDN'T WANT

THEN GET THE PACKAGE
FOR LOIS TO TAKE TO ATLANTA

FOR HER TRIP LATER THAT NIGHT.

I KEPT LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW,

AND I SAW THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS GONE.

MICHAEL, WATCH THE SAUCE, ALL RIGHT?

STAY HERE WITH YOUR UNCLE MICHAEL.

I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

SO I ASKED MY BROTHER MICHAEL
TO WATCH THE SAUCE,

AND KAREN AND I STARTED OUT.

OH, GOD, I SEE IT.

I SEE IT.

DAMN. YEP, THAT'S IT.

WE GOT TO GET TO YOUR MOTHER'S.

NO. I'VE SEEN ENOUGH HELICOPTERS

FOR ONE DAY, THANK YOU.

MY PLAN WAS I HAD TO GET HOME

AND GET THE PACKAGE READY FOR LOIS

TO TAKE ON HER TRIP.

ALSO, I HAD TO GET TO SANDY'S HOUSE

TO GIVE THE PACKAGE
A WHACK WITH QUININE.

[TELEPHONE RINGS]

PLUS, I KNEW SANDY
WAS GONNA GET ON MY ( … ).

THEN I HAD THE COOKING
TO FINISH AT HOME,

AND I HAD TO GET LOIS
READY FOR HER TRIP.

IT'S SANDY.

Pain in the ( … ). YEAH?

Sandy: HEY, BABE. WHEN YOU COMIN' OVER?

I'LL BE THERE IN ABOUT AN HOUR.

YOU'RE STAYING TONIGHT, RIGHT?

I CAN'T. I GOT MY BROTHER TONIGHT.

OH, HENRY, WE GOTTA--

STOP, STOP, STOP.

WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT LATER, OK? GOOD-BYE.

[RING]

HELLO.

Henry: HEY, IT'S ME. YOU READY?

YEAH.

TELL MICHAEL NOT TO LET
THE SAUCE STICK. KEEP STIRRING.

HENRY SAYS DON'T LET THE SAUCE STICK.

I'M STIRRING IT.

Henry: LISTEN, YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO?

YEAH, YEAH.

DON'T "YEAH, YEAH" ME, LOIS.
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

MAKE SURE YOU LEAVE THE HOUSE
WHEN YOU MAKE THE CALL.

YOU UNDERSTAND ME? YOU HEAR ME?
CALL FROM AN OUTSIDE LINE.

I MEAN IT.

JESUS! YOU MUST THINK I'M DUMB.

WHAT ARE YOU BUGGING ME FOR?

I KNOW WHAT TO DO.

HEY, YOU LITTLE HICK,
JUST MAKE SURE YOU DO IT!

PFFT! YOU'RE SUCH A PAIN.

HEY! JUST DO IT!

OK.

WHAT DID HE SAY?

NOTHING.

SO WHAT DOES SHE DO
AFTER SHE HANGS UP WITH ME?

AFTER EVERYTHING I TOLD HER,

AFTER ALL HER
"YEAH, YEAH, YEAH," BULL( … )?

SHE PICKS UP THE PHONE
AND CALLS FROM THE HOUSE.

NOW IF ANYBODY WAS LISTENING,
THEY'D KNOW EVERYTHING.

THEY'D KNOW THAT A PACKAGE
WAS LEAVING FROM MY HOUSE,

AND THEY'D EVEN HAVE
THE TIME AND THE FLIGHT NUMBER.

HI. IT'S LOIS.

AS SOON AS I GOT HOME,
I STARTED COOKING.

I HAD A FEW HOURS UNTIL LOIS' FLIGHT.

I TOLD MY BROTHER
TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE STOVE.

ALL DAY LONG,
THE POOR GUY'S BEEN WATCHING

HELICOPTERS AND TOMATO SAUCE.

I HAD TO DRIVE OVER TO SANDY'S PLACE,

MIX THE STUFF ONCE,

WHAT COULD I DO IF SHE INSISTED

I THREW THE PACKAGE IN THE KITCHEN,

AND I WENT TO TAKE HER HOME.

A HAT?

DON'T YOU MOVE, YOU MOTHER( … )ER,

OR I'LL BLOW YOUR BRAINS OUT.

FOR A SECOND, I THOUGHT I WAS DEAD.

BUT WHEN I HEARD ALL THE NOISE,

I KNEW THEY WERE COPS.

ONLY COPS TALK THAT WAY.

DON'T ( … )IN' MOVE.

IF THEY HAD BEEN WISEGUYS,

I WOULDN'T HAVE HEARD A THING.

I WOULD'VE BEEN DEAD.

MICHAEL, LOCK THE DOOR!

[POLICE BANGING ON DOOR]

AAH! AAH!

OK. OK.

Man: 1, 2, 3. LET'S GO!

WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU TOOK A COLLAR?

HEY, ( … )HEAD, I'M TALKING TO YOU.

YOU DON'T WANT TO SAY
A ( … )IN' WORD TO ME,

YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING.

I DON'T GIVE A ( … ). 25 YEARS, PAL--

THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO.

LET'S SEE HOW MUCH OF A GOOD GUY

YOU'RE GONNA BE THEN.

ALL DAY, I THOUGHT THE GUYS
IN THE HELICOPTER

WERE JUST LOCAL COPS BUSTING
MY ( … )S OVER LUFTHANSA.

THEY TURNED OUT TO BE NARCS.

THEY'D BEEN ON ME A MONTH--

PHONE TAPS, SURVEILLANCE, EVERYTHING.

YOU KNOW THE BOYS. HOW YOU DOING, BOYS?

ALL THE PALS ARE HERE.

YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK TO ME,

YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A PROBLEM ALL NIGHT.

WHAT THE ( … ) IS YOUR PROBLEM?

25 TO LIFE. NEW YORK STATE.

25 ( … )ING YEARS, PAL.

I'LL SLAP YOUR ( … )ING
HEAD INSIDE OUT.

JERRY, WHAT WERE YOU GUYS,
GROCERY SHOPPING?

WHAT, ARE WE GONNA MAKE A CAKE?

YOU GONNA MAKE A ( … )ING CAKE, HMM?

YOU GOT ANYTHING GOOD IN THERE?

IS IT GOOD?

HA HA HA HA!

BYE-BYE, ( … )HEAD. HA HA HA HA!

SEE YOU IN ATTICA, ( … ).

I SPOKE TO JIMMY. HE OFFERED
TO GIVE ME SOME MONEY.

HE JUST WANTS TO KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING.

HE JUST WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.

( … ) JIMMY AND HIS MONEY.
I GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE

AND STRAIGHTEN OUT
EVERYTHING WITH PAULIE,

OR ELSE I'M DEAD, KAREN.

THEN YOU'RE BETTER OFF STAYING IN HERE.

THEY CAN WHACK ME IN HERE

JUST AS EASY AS THEY CAN OUTSIDE,

MAYBE EVEN EASIER.

THEY'RE AFRAID I'M GONNA RAT THEM OUT.

PEOPLE ALREADY ARE WALKING AWAY FROM ME.

I'M DEAD IN HERE. YOU GOTTA GET ME OUT.

KAREN FINALLY GOT HER MOTHER

TO PUT HER HOUSE UP
FOR MY BAIL, AND I WAS OUT.

I REMEMBER I HAD THIS FEELING

I WAS GONNA GET KILLED
RIGHT OUTSIDE THE JAIL.

I KNEW PAULIE WAS STILL PISSED AT ME,

AND HE'S SUCH A HOTHEAD,

AND I WAS WORRIED ABOUT JIMMY.

SEE, JIMMY KNEW IF PAULIE FOUND OUT

HE WAS IN THE ( … ) DEALS WITH ME,

PAULIE WOULD HAVE JIMMY
WHACKED EVEN BEFORE ME.

THIS IS THE BAD TIME.

I DIDN'T FEEL SAFE

UNTIL I GOT HOME.

SO NOW MY PLAN WAS TO STAY ALIVE

LONG ENOUGH TO SELL OFF THE DOPE

THAT THE COPS NEVER FOUND

AND THEN DISAPPEAR FOR A WHILE

UNTIL I CAN GET THINGS STRAIGHTENED OUT.

KAREN! ( … ).

WHERE'S THE STUFF THAT I LEFT, KAREN?

I FLUSHED IT DOWN THE TOILET.

YOU WHAT?

WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

THEY WERE ALL OVER THE HOUSE.

KAREN, THAT WAS WORTH $60,000!

I NEED THAT MONEY! THAT'S ALL WE GOT.

THEY HAD A SEARCH WARRANT.

THEY WERE IN EVERYTHING.

THAT'S ALL THE MONEY THAT WE HAD, KAREN!

I WAS DEPENDING ON THAT.
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

I HAD TO! THEY WERE GONNA FIND IT.

( … ), KAREN, THEY WOULD
HAVE NEVER FOUND IT!

THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND IT!

I SWEAR TO YOU, HENRY.
THEY WOULD'VE FOUND IT.

OH, NO!

WHY DID YOU DO THAT?! WHY?!

THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND IT,
I SWEAR TO YOU.

OH, MY GOD.

OH, MY GOD!

HENRY.

[CRYING]

NO! NO! NO.

WHY?

OH, GOD. OH, GOD!

[HORN HONKS]

PAULIE, I'M REALLY SORRY.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO SAY.

I KNOW I ( … )ED UP.

( … )ED UP? YEAH, YOU ( … )ED UP.

YOU KNOW, BUT I'M ALL RIGHT NOW.

I CAN BE TRUSTED NOW.

PAULIE, I'M CLEAN.
ON MY KIDS, I'M CLEAN.

YOU LOOKED IN MY EYES,

AND YOU LIED TO ME.

YOU TREATED ME LIKE A ( … )IN' JERK,

LIKE I WAS NEVER NOTHING TO YOU.

PAULIE, AFTER WHAT YOU SAID,
I COULDN'T COME TO YOU.

YOU KNOW, I WAS-- I WAS ASHAMED.

I--I'M ASHAMED NOW.

BUT I GOT NOWHERE ELSE TO GO, PAULIE.

YOU'RE ALL I'VE GOT.

AND I REALLY, REALLY NEED YOUR HELP.

I REALLY DO.

TAKE THIS.

NOW I GOTTA TURN MY BACK ON YOU.

OK.

3,200 BUCKS. THAT'S WHAT HE GAVE ME.

3,200 BUCKS FOR A LIFETIME.

IT WASN'T EVEN ENOUGH
TO PAY FOR THE COFFIN.

WE GOTTA GET OUT!

I DON'T WANT TO RUN.

WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO,

JUST PICK UP AND LEAVE
EVERYTHING? GO HIDING?

I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT, HENRY.

IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

IF WE STAY AROUND HERE, WE'RE DEAD.

YOU GOT IT? WE'RE DEAD.

THEY'RE RIGHT.

YOU TOOK TOO MUCH OF THAT STUFF.

YOU'RE TOTALLY PARANOID.

HOW'S HE DOING? BUSTIN' HIS ( … )S?

HE'S OK.

IT SOBERED HIM UP.

GOOD, GOOD, VERY GOOD. GLAD TO HEAR IT.

YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF QUESTIONS

THEY BEEN ASKING HIM? DID HE TELL YA?

JIMMY, I DON'T KNOW.

I GOT MY MIND ON SO MANY OTHER THINGS.

I GOT NO MONEY.

THE GIRLS ARE OLD ENOUGH
TO READ THE NEWSPAPERS.

TELL HIM HE'S GOTTA CALL ME, OK?

AS SOON AS YOU TALK TO HIM,

HE'S GOTTA CALL ME.

WE GOTTA WORK ON THIS WHOLE THING.

IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

HE DOESN'T KNOW
I CAME DOWN HERE TO SEE YOU.

IT'S LIKE HE'S CRAZY.

TAKE THIS FOR NOW.
IT'S A COUPLE THOUSAND.

THANKS, JIMMY.

DON'T WORRY, HONEY.

EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

LISTEN, I GOT SOME
BEAUTIFUL DIOR DRESSES.

PICK OUT A FEW FOR YOURSELF.

FOR MY MOM.

YEAH, WHATEVER. TAKE A FEW.

NO, NO, NO. IT'S OVER HERE.

SEE THE STORE ON THE CORNER?

IT'S SWAG, SO I GOT IT
DOWN ON THE CORNER.

OK?

GO AHEAD, SWEETHEART. I'LL SEE YOU.

THANKS, JIMMY.

DON'T WORRY.

I'LL TRY.

DON'T FORGET. HE'S GOTTA CALL ME.

ALL RIGHT.

OVER HERE?

RIGHT DOWN THERE.

YEAH.

NO, NO. IT'S RIGHT OVER THERE.

RIGHT ON THE CORNER.

IT'S OVER THERE. RIGHT THERE.

NO. NO, NO, NO, NO. HEY, GO AHEAD!

IT'S RIGHT IN THERE!

NO, JIMMY. I'M IN A HURRY!

MY MOM'S WATCHING THE
KIDS. I GOTTA GET HOME!

I'LL COME BACK LATER!

[TIRES SCREECHING]

KAREN? KAREN?

WHAT HAPPENED?

KAREN?

NOTHING.

WHAT HAPPENED?

I JUST GOT SCARED. I JUST GOT SCARED.

YOU GOT THE KEYS?

WHAT HAPPENED, KAREN?

I JUST GOT SCARED, HENRY. IT'S OK.

YOU ALL RIGHT?

YEAH.

[CRYING]

SHH.

IF YOU'RE PART OF A CREW,

NOBODY EVER TELLS YOU THAT
THEY'RE GOING TO KILL YOU.

IT DOESN'T HAPPEN THAT WAY.

THERE WEREN'T ANY ARGUMENTS OR CURSES

LIKE IN THE MOVIES.

SEE, YOUR MURDERERS COME WITH SMILES.

THEY COME AS YOUR FRIENDS,

THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE CARED
FOR YOU ALL OF YOUR LIFE,

AND THEY ALWAYS SEEM TO COME AT A TIME

WHEN YOU'RE AT YOUR WEAKEST

AND MOST IN NEED OF THEIR HELP.

SO I MET JIMMY IN A CROWDED
PLACE WE BOTH KNEW.

I GOT THERE 15 MINUTES EARLY,

AND I SAW THAT JIMMY WAS ALREADY THERE.

WE TOOK THE BOOTH NEAR THE WINDOW

SO WE COULD SEE EVERYONE
WHO DROVE UP TO THE RESTAURANT.

HE WANTED TO MAKE SURE I WASN'T TAILED.

HE WAS JUMPY. HE HADN'T TOUCHED A THING.

ON THE SURFACE, OF COURSE,

EVERYTHING WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FINE.

WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE
DISCUSSING MY CASE.

BUT I HAD THE FEELING
JIMMY WAS TRYING TO SENSE

WHETHER I WAS GONNA RAT HIM OUT
TO SAVE MY NECK.

I BEEN TELLING YOU YOUR WHOLE LIFE--

DON'T TALK ON THE ( … )ING
PHONE, RIGHT?

NOW YOU UNDERSTAND, HUH?

BUT IT'S GONNA BE OK.

I THINK YOU GOT A GOOD CHANCE
OF BEATING THE CASE.

YEAH, WELL... YOU KNOW THAT KID,

YOU KNOW, FROM THE CITY,
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT?

YOU KNOW WHO I'M TALKIN' ABOUT?

YEAH.

THE KID TURNED OUT TO BE A RAT.

SOON AS HE GOT PINCHED,
HE RATTED EVERYBODY OUT.

HE RATTED YOUSE ALL OUT.

BUT I KNOW WHERE HE IS. HE'S HIDING OUT.

HE'S--KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

WOULD YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
GOING WITH ANTHONY ON VACATION

AND TAKE CARE OF THAT?

MM-MMM.

NO. NOT AT ALL.

THAT WAY, THEY GOT NOTHING, HUH?

JIMMY HAD NEVER ASKED ME
TO WHACK SOMEBODY BEFORE,

BUT NOW HE'S ASKING ME
TO GO DOWN TO FLORIDA

AND DO A HIT WITH ANTHONY.

THAT'S WHEN I KNEW

I WOULD NEVER HAVE COME BACK
FROM FLORIDA ALIVE.

YOU KNOW WHAT?

I THINK I'LL HAVE AN ENGLISH MUFFIN.

I ASKED YOU ONCE. I'LL TELL YOU AGAIN.

I DON'T WANT TO GO ANYPLACE THAT'S COLD.

YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE
A CHOICE IN THAT MATTER.

ED, COME ON,

JUST WHOEVER ( … )ING CONTROLS IT

JUST NOPLACE COLD, ALL RIGHT?

DO THAT FOR ME. I'M TRYING TO--

HE'S BRONCHIAL, THAT'S WHY.

IF HE'S LEGITIMATELY BRONCHIAL,

WE'LL TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION.

I'M LEGITIMATELY BRONCHIAL.

OK. CAN I ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS?

WHAT ABOUT MY PARENTS?

WHAT ABOUT THEM?

AM I GONNA SEE THEM,
AM I GONNA TALK TO THEM?

DON'T I HAVE SOME KIND
OF CONTACT WITH THEM?

NO.

NO?

WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE.

YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT, GOD FORBID,

SOMETHING HAPPENS TO MY PARENTS

AND THEY GET SICK,
I CAN'T GO AND SEE THEM?

MAYBE SOMETHING CAN BE WORKED OUT

IF THEY'RE SICK,

IF THERE'S SOME EXTRAORDINARY
SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES.

I CAN'T DO THIS, HENRY. I CAN'T.

I CAN'T LEAVE MY PARENTS.

EXCUSE ME.

KAREN, I TOLD YOU BEFORE,

I'M NOT GONNA DO THIS

UNLESS YOU AND THE KIDS COME WITH ME.

I CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT YOU, OK?

SO YOU DO WHATEVER, BUT THAT'S IT.

YOU NEED HENRY.
YOU DON'T NEED ME, RIGHT?

THAT'S RIGHT. FRANKLY, I DON'T
CARE WHETHER YOU GO OR NOT.

IF IT'S GONNA MAKE HIM

A HAPPIER WITNESS, A BETTER WITNESS,

I'D LIKE YOU TO BE WITH HIM.

THEY WANT HENRY. THEY DON'T WANT ME.

BUT HENRY'S GONNA BE IN THE
WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM.

THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO GET HIM.

THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN TO GET TO HIM

IS BY GETTING TO YOU
OR GETTING TO YOUR KIDS.

IF HE GOES INTO THE PROGRAM,
FORGET ABOUT IT.

YOU'RE IN A GREAT DEAL OF DANGER.

BUT I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

DON'T GIVE ME
THE "BABE IN THE WOODS" ROUTINE.

I'VE LISTENED TO THOSE WIRETAPS.

I HEARD YOU ON THE TELEPHONE.
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT COCAINE.

CONVERSATION AFTER CONVERSATION,

YOU'RE TALKING TO HENRY ON THE PHONE...

IT DOESN'T MATTER, BECAUSE
WHETHER HE GOES TO JAIL

OR WHETHER HE STAYS ON
THE STREET, HE BEATS THE CASE,

HE'S A DEAD MAN.

HE KNOWS IT. YOU KNOW IT.

WHAT ABOUT THE KIDS, WITH SCHOOL?

DO THEY GET LEFT BACK? WHAT GOES ON?

WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
GO DOWN TO WALL STREET

AND GET SOME REAL ( … )ING CROOKS?

WHOEVER SOLD YOU THOSE SUITS

HAD A WONDERFUL SENSE OF HUMOR.

WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO, KAREN,

IS WE'RE BASICALLY YOUR ONLY SALVATION.

WE'RE GONNA SAVE YOUR LIFE,
WE'RE GONNA SAVE HIS LIFE,

AND WE'RE GONNA KEEP YOU OUT OF JAIL.

[SIGHS]

MR. HILL, THIS MORNING,

YOU TOLD THE MEMBERS OF THIS JURY...

IT WAS EASY FOR ALL OF US TO DISAPPEAR.

MY HOUSE WAS IN MY MOTHER-IN-LAW'S NAME,

MY CARS WERE REGISTERED TO MY WIFE,

MY SOCIAL SECURITY CARDS
AND DRIVER'S LICENSES

WERE PHONIES.

I NEVER VOTED. I NEVER PAID TAXES.

MY BIRTH CERTIFICATE
AND MY ARREST SHEET--

THAT'S ALL YOU'D EVER HAVE
TO KNOW I WAS ALIVE.

DO YOU SEE HIM HERE
IN THE COURTROOM TODAY?

YES.

PLEASE POINT HIM OUT
FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE JURY.

YOUR HONOR, PLEASE
LET THE RECORD REFLECT

THAT MR. HILL HAS IDENTIFIED
THE DEFENDANT JAMES CONWAY.

DO YOU ALSO KNOW A MAN
BY THE NAME OF PAUL CICERO?

YES.

DO YOU SEE HIM HERE
IN THE COURTROOM TODAY?

YES.

CAN YOU POINT HIM OUT
FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE JURY?

LET THE RECORD REFLECT
THAT MR. HILL HAS IDENTIFIED

THE DEFENDANT PAUL CICERO.

YOUR HONOR, I HAVE A DOCUMENT...

SEE, THE HARDEST THING FOR ME
WAS LEAVING THE LIFE.

I STILL LOVE THE LIFE.

WE WERE TREATED LIKE
MOVIE STARS WITH MUSCLE.

WE HAD IT ALL JUST FOR THE ASKING.

OUR WIVES, MOTHERS, KIDS,
EVERYBODY RODE ALONG.

I HAD PAPER BAGS

FILLED WITH JEWELRY
STASHED IN THE KITCHEN.

I HAD A SUGAR BOWL
FULL OF COKE TO NEXT THE BED.

RATS WILL DO ANYTHING TO SURVIVE.

ISN'T THAT RIGHT, MR. HILL?

OBJECTION!

OBJECTION SUSTAINED.

I DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT BEING A RAT.

YOU KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT BEING A RAT.

OBJECTION! IN VIEW OF THE VIOLENCE...

ANYTHING I WANTED
WAS A PHONE CALL AWAY--

FREE CARS, THE KEYS
TO A DOZEN HIDEOUT FLATS

ALL OVER THE CITY.

I'D BET 20, 30 GRAND OVER A WEEKEND,

AND THEN I'D EITHER BLOW
THE WINNINGS IN A WEEK

OR GO TO THE SHARKS
TO PAY BACK THE BOOKIES.

IT DIDN'T MATTER.
IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

WHEN I WAS BROKE,

I WOULD GO OUT AND ROB SOME MORE.

WE RAN EVERYTHING. WE PAID OFF COPS.

WE PAID OFF LAWYERS. WE PAID OFF JUDGES.

EVERYBODY HAD THEIR HANDS OUT.

EVERYTHING WAS FOR THE TAKING.

AND NOW IT'S ALL OVER.

AND THAT'S THE HARDEST PART.

TODAY, EVERYTHING IS DIFFERENT.

THERE'S NO ACTION.

I HAVE TO WAIT AROUND
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

CAN'T EVEN GET DECENT FOOD.

RIGHT AFTER I GOT HERE,

I ORDERED SOME SPAGHETTI
WITH MARINARA SAUCE,

AND I GOT EGG NOODLES AND KETCHUP.

I'M AN AVERAGE NOBODY.

I GET TO LIVE THE REST
OF MY LIFE LIKE A SCHNOOK.
