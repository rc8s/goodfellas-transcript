Henry: As far back as I can remember,

I always wanted to be a gangster.

Even before I first wandered into
the cabstand for an after-school job,

I knew I wanted to be a part of them.

It was there that I knew that I belonged.

I mean, to me, it meant being somebody

in a neighborhood that was full of nobodies.

They weren't like anybody else.

I mean, they did whatever they wanted.

They double-parked in front of a hydrant,

and nobody ever gave them a ticket.

In the summer, when they played cards all night,

nobody ever called the cops.

Tony Stacks, how are you?

Tuddy Cicero.

Could this be the Canarsie Kid?

Hello, Tony.

How are you? Good, good.

Tuddy.

Tuddy ran the cabstand
and the Bella Vista Pizzeria

and a few other places for his brother Paul,

who was the boss over everybody
in the neighborhood.

Come on. Come on.

Hello, Paulie.

Hey, Paulie.

Paulie might've moved slow...

but it was only because

Paulie didn't have to move for anybody.

♪ Must I forever be a beggar? ♪

It's your fault. You started it.

I started it? It's your fault.

Hey, Junior, here.

At first, my parents loved that I found a job

across the street from the house.

My father, who was Irish,
was sent to work at the age of 11.

And he liked that I got myself a job.

He always used to say

that American kids were spoiled lazy.

Bye, sis!

Bye, Dad.

Bye. Take your lunch.

See ya, Mikey.
Say goodbye to your brother?

Bye, Henry.

Henry! Watch how you cross!

And bring back milk!

And my mother was happy after she found out

that the Ciceros came from the
same part of Sicily as she did.

I mean, to my mother,
that was the answer to all her prayers.

♪ Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh ♪

I was the luckiest kid in the world.

I could go anywhere. I could do anything.

I knew everybody, and everybody knew me.

Wiseguys would pull up,

and Tuddy would toss me their keys

and let me park their Cadillacs.

I mean, here I am, this little kid,

I can't even see over the steering wheel,

and I'm parking Cadillacs.

♪ Can't we be sweethearts?
Why don't we fall in love? ♪

But it wasn't too long

before my parents changed their minds

about my job at the cabstand.

This is for your mother and sister.

Make sure you give them to them.

For them, the cabstand was supposed
to be a part-time job,

but for me, it was definitely full-time.

That's all I wanted to do.

You see, people like my father could never understand,

but I was a part of something.

I belonged. I was treated like a grown-up.

All right, look, Henry. Tell him 519.

Every day, I was learning to score --

a dollar here, a dollar there.

I was living in a fantasy.

Did you have a good day at school today?

Henry: And my father was always ticked off.

He was ticked that he made such lousy money.

He was ticked that my kid brother Michael was in a wheelchair.

He was ticked that there were seven
of us living in such a tiny house.

Why don't you tell me about this?
It's a letter from school.

Says you haven't been there in months.

In months!

Henry's mother: Oh! Aah!

You think you're so smart?!
You're nothing but a bum!

[ Screaming ]

You want to grow up to be a bum?

But after a while, he was mostly ticked

because I hung around the cabstand.

He knew what went on at that cabstand.

And every once in a while, I'd have to take a beating,

but by then, I didn't care.

The way I saw it,

everybody takes a beating sometime.

I can't make any more deliveries.

What do you mean you can't make any more deliveries?

My dad said he's gonna kill me. Look.

Come on with me.

Is that him there, kid?

No.

What about him?

Nope.

That's the guy.

Get him.

Excuse me.

Yeah?

Scumball.

Hey, hey, hey!

Get in there.

Come here.

[ Choking ]

You know this kid?

Yeah.

You know where he lives?

Deliver mail to his house? Answer.

Yeah.

Well, from now on,
any letter from that school

to that kid's house comes directly here. You understand?

Yeah.

If another letter from that school

goes to that kid's house,
in you're gonna go headfirst.

That was it.

No more letters from truant officers,

no more letters from school.

In fact, no more letters from anybody.

Finally, after a couple of weeks,

my mother had to go to the post office and complain.

How could I go back to school after that

and pledge allegiance to the flag

and sit through good-government garbage?

Paulie hated phones.

He wouldn't have one in his house.

Mikey called.
You want me to call him back?

Yeah, all right, make the call. Go ahead.

All right. Come on, Henry.

He used to get all his calls secondhand,

then you'd have to call the people back

from an outside phone.

You got a nickel? Yeah.

Get him on the phone for me.

Yeah. Don't get your feet wet.

There were guys, that's all they did,

all day long, was take care of Paulie's phone calls.

[ Indistinct conversations ]

For a guy who moved all day long,

Paulie didn't talk to six people.

If there was a union problem or,
say, a beef in the numbers,

then only the top guys could meet
with Paulie to discuss the problem.

Everything was one-on-one.
Paulie hated conferences.

He didn't want anybody hearing what he said,

and he didn't want anybody

listening to what he was being told.

Hundreds of guys depended on Paulie,

and he got a piece of everything they made.

It was tribute, just like in the old country,

except they were doing it here in America.

And all they got from Paulie

was protection from other guys looking to rip them off.

And that's what it's all about.

That's what the FBI could never understand --

that what Paulie and the organization does

is offer protection for people
who can't go to the cops.

That's it. That's all it is.

They're like the police department for wiseguys.

[ Glass shatters ]

People looked at me differently.

I mean, they knew I was with somebody.

I didn't have to wait in line at the bakery

on Sunday mornings anymore for fresh bread.

The owner knew who I was with,

and he'd come from around the counter.

No matter how many people were waiting,

I was taken care of first.

Our neighbors didn't park
in our driveway anymore,

even though we didn't have a car.

At 13, I was making more money

than most of the grown-ups in the neighborhood.

I mean, I had more money than
I could spend. I had it all.

One day -- one day, some of the kids from the neighborhood

carried my mother's groceries
all the way home.

You know why?

It was out of respect.

Hi, Mom! What do you think?

Look at my shoes. Aren't they great?

My God. You look like a gangster.

They shot me! Help! Help!

They shot me! They shot me!

Tuddy: Henry, shut the door.
Shut the door!

That was the first time
I had ever seen anyone shot.

Can't have that in here.
I can't have that in this joint.

I remember feeling bad about the guy,

but I also remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.

I knew Paulie didn't
want anybody dying in the building.

You're a real jerk.

You wasted eight aprons on this guy.

I don't know what the hell's wrong with you.

I got to toughen this kid up.

It was a glorious time.

And wiseguys were all over the place.

It was before "Appalachian"
and before "Crazy" Joe

decided to take on a boss and start a war.

It was when I met the world.

It was when I first met Jimmy Conway.

He couldn't have been more than 28 or 29 at the time,

but he was already a legend.

He'd walk in the door,

and everybody who worked the room just went wild.

He'd give the doorman $100 just for opening the door.

He'd shove hundreds in the pockets of the dealers

and all the guys that ran the games.

I mean, the bartender got $100

just for keeping the ice cubes cold.

The Irishman is here
to take all you guineas' money.

[ Laughs ]

You want a drink?

Give me a seven-and-seven.

Jimmy, I'd like you
to meet the kid -- Henry.

How you doing? A pleasure.

Thank you.

Keep them coming.

See, Jimmy was one of the most
feared guys in the city.

He was first locked up at 11,

and he was doing hits
for mob bosses when he was 16.

See, hits never bothered Jimmy.
It was business.

But what Jimmy really loved to do?

What he really loved to do was steal.

I mean, he actually enjoyed it.

Jimmy was the kind of guy

who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.

Give me your wallet.

You might know who we are,
but we know who you are. You understand?

Yeah, he was one of the city's
biggest hijackers of booze,

cigarettes, razor blades,
shrimp, and lobsters.

Shrimp and lobsters were best.

They went really fast.

And almost all of them were gimmes.

I mean, they just gave it up, no problem.

They called him Jimmy the Gent.

The drivers loved him.

They used to tip him off about
the really good loads,

and of course everybody got a piece.

Woman: Thanks, Jimmy.
I'll be back for the rest later.

Okay, I'll see you later.

Henry, come here.

Say hello to Tommy.

How you doing, Henry?

Youse are gonna be working together.

Okay? Help him. Go ahead.

Hey, Jimmy! You got anything good?

And when the cops,

they assigned a whole army to stop Jimmy,

what did he do?

He made them partners.

Okay. Jimmy, I'd complain, but who'd listen?

Give me one Pall Mall.

What do you need?

I'll take two Luckys. Two Luckys.

Here you go, Henry. Thanks a lot.

Here you go. Two Luckys. Thanks.

What do you need?

One Pall Mall.

One Pall Mall. Here you go.

Whoa, whoa. What do you think you're doing?

No, it's all right.

How many cartons you need?

Where'd you get those cigarettes?

It's all right.

Get him out of here. Get him out of here.

It's okay.
It's not okay.

Get him out of here.
Get him out of here.

No, you don't understand.

No, you don't understand.

Henry got pinched.

Where?

By the factory -- selling cigarettes.

Uh, yes, sir, that's me.

Henry? Come over here.

Just stand over here.

Now, stay there.

Counselor, proceed.

Hi, Jimmy.

Congratulations.

And here's your graduation present.

Present? What for? I got pinched.

Everybody gets pinched, but you did it right.

You told them nothing and they got nothing.

I thought you'd be mad.

Mad? I'm not mad at you.
I'm proud of you.

You took your first pinch like a man,

and you learned
the two greatest things in life.

What?

Look at me.

Never rat on your friends...

and always keep your mouth shut.

Oh, you broke your cherry!

By the time I grew up,

there was $30 billion a year in cargo

moving through Idlewild Airport.

And, believe me,
we tried to steal every bit of it.

See, you got to understand,
we grew up near the airport.

It belonged to Paulie.

We had friends and relatives
who worked all over the place,

and they would tip us off

about what was coming in
and what was moving out.

If any of the truckers or
airlines gave us any trouble,

Paulie had his union people
scare them with a strike.

It was beautiful.

It was an even bigger
moneymaker than numbers,

and Jimmy was in charge of it all.

Whenever we needed money,
we'd rob the airport.

To us, it was better than Citibank.

♪ The nightingale tells his fairy tale ♪

Hey, do you have a phone?

Come on, come on. You got a phone?

Phone's over there.

Just stole my truck. You believe that, huh?

Can you believe that?

There was Jimmy and Tommy and me.

And there was Anthony Stabile.

How you doin'?

Frankie Carbone.

[ Speaking Italian ]

And then there was
Moe Black's brother, Fat Andy.

How you doing, buddy?

And his guys, Frankie the Wop...

staying out of trouble?

...Freddie No-Nose.

How you doing?

And then there was Pete the Killer,

who was Sally Balls' brother.

I took care of that thing for you.

And you had Nicky Eyes.

What's up, guy?

And Mikey Franzese.

I saw that guy -- yeah, I want to see him.

And Jimmy Two-Times,
who got that nickname

because he said everything twice, like...

I'm gonna go get the papers,
get the papers.

Vinnie, they're gonna be out of style

by the time you get this thing going.

Lift it. Watch the wall.

Coming through. Watch.

Come on, Vinnie. We got coats. Move.

What is this, coats? Coats.

Henry -- I need suits, Henry, not coats.

Suits are, uh, coming Thursday.

I know, but this is the middle of summer.

What am I gonna do with fur coats?

You don't want furs, I'll take the furs --
Don't take them away. I want them.

You know what we'll do?

We'll hang them in the freezer
with the meat. How's that?

For us, to live any other way was nuts.

I mean, to us, those goody-good people

who worked for bum paychecks

and took the subway to work every day,

worried about their bills, were dead.

I mean, they were suckers.

If we wanted something, we just took it.

If anyone complained twice,
they got hit so bad,

believe me, they never complained again.

It was just all routine, and
you didn't even think about it.

Tommy: Frankie, Frankie, Frankie.

This 520 -- you have to do a 460.

520 ain't even close to 460.

What has that got to do with anything?

I've been playing
that number for three years.

Hey, Henry. How you doing?

Piece of cake -- it's all there.

Don't worry about the alarms.

Just got to find a way to get the key.

No problem, right? I'll take care of it.

How you doing? Good to see you.

Tell him what you were
telling me now, Frenchy.

Too good to be true.

Okay. Well, it's beautiful.

It's totally, totally untraceable, okay?

but I got something all worked out.

It'll be me and Frenchy.

Yeah, the guy's a piece of work.

there could be like a half a mil
coming in, all cash.

I don't think it'll be a problem at all.

Good. We're on.

Funny is, the freaking bank job
away in Secaucus.

I'm in the middle of the
freaking weeds laying down.

He comes over, he says, "What are you doing?"

I said, "I'm resting." "Here you're resting?!

It's not a freaking beach or the park."

I said, "I'm resting! I know
I'm resting. I'm resting."

They pull me in. They start giving me
all kinds of questions.

You know, this and that.

He says, "Oh, so, what are you
gonna tell us, tough guy?"

I said, "My usual -- zero, nothing.

Why tell you, Mick?"

He said, "No, you're gonna tell
me something today, tough guy."

I said, "All right. I'll tell you something.

Go feed your mother."

Bing, pow, boom, bing!

You saw the paper, Anthony?

My head was up like this.

So now I'm coming around.

You know, I start to come out of it.

Who do I see in front of me?
This big Mick again.

He says, "Oh, what do you want
to tell me now, tough guy?"

I said, "Mick, what are you doing here?

I thought I told you
to go feed your mother."

You stuttering fool, you!

Frankie, was he shaking?

You may fold under questioning.

What the hell is it with you?

I thought I was
getting pinched over here.

He's hanging on my freaking neck
like a vulture.

Like impending dan-- what do you want?

This guy's worried.

He didn't want to come over
and give the check, you know?

The waiter? You could take care of it.

Yeah, it's no problem.
Tell him to put it on my tab. Of course.

That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

You know, it ain't just this here.

It's 7 freaking big ones here.

7 freaking G's you owe me.

$7,000 -- I mean, it ain't peanuts.

I don't mean
to be out of order or nothing.

[ Chuckles ] You don't mean to be out of order?

Geez, it's good you don't mean
to be out of order.

No disrespect.

You call embarrassing me
in front of my friends,

like calling me a deadbeat, you know?

You know, Sonny, you're a real freaking mutt.

You know the money we spend
in this freaking --

Come on. Don't be like that.

What do you mean, "Don't be like that"?

Aah!

But I'm worried. I mean,

I'm hearing all kinds of freaking bad things.

I mean, he's treating me like
I'm a freaking ---- or something.

I gotta go on the lam in order
to get away from this guy?

This ain't right, Paulie.

I mean, I can't go here, I can't go there --

You think you're the only one?

I talked to them a million
times. They don't listen.

If you tell him, he'll stop.

I mean, what am I gonna do?

I'm gonna wind up being declared an M.I.A.?

They're gonna find me in the back of a car

somewhere in the weeds?

Come on. You know this Tommy
all your life.

Who knows better than you?

This sucker's an archcriminal.

I mean, when I leave my house in the morning,

before I get to the car,
I'm looking over both shoulders.

This is no way to live.
You know I'm no fence jumper.

I'm around you all my life.

You tell me what I got to do.

If there was something I could do,

don't you think I would do it?

You know me. I would like to help you out.

Sonny, tell him what we talked about.

You think it's all right?
Yeah, go on.

What?

Well, you know, look,
maybe you could come in with me.

You know, take a piece
of the joint. That'd be good.

What are you talking about?

What do you mean, the restaurant?

Yeah, I mean, it's a classy place.

I mean, look at the layout.

You've been in there a million times.

You know what it looks like.

I mean, Tommy taking over
this freaking joint

is like putting a silk hat on a pig.

I mean, I don't mean
no disrespect or nothing, Henry,

but that's the way it is.
I know you're his friend.

[ Sighs heavily ]

I'm begging you. What can I say?

What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?

What's he want from me?

I don't know nothing
about the restaurant business.

Nothing. All I know is how
to sit down and order the meal.

I don't know how to make a restaurant.

No, not for you.
It's just a place to hang.

You know, I mean, the chef is great.

The shows are good.

There's a lot of ----
coming in here all the time.

I'd like to help you out.

Look, what do you want from me?
What am I gonna do?

Tommy's a bad kid. He's a bad seed.

What am I supposed to do, shoot him?

That wouldn't be a bad idea.

I'm sorry I said that.
I didn't mean to say that.

I-I just mean that he's scaring me.

You know -- I just --
I need help, all right?

Help me, please, you know.

You know anything
about this restaurant business?

He knows everything about it.

I mean, he's in the joint 24 hours a day.

I mean, another freaking few
minutes, he could be a stool.

That's how often he's in here.
You understand me?

You want me to be your partner?

Yeah.

Is that what you're trying to tell me?

You want me to be partner?

Yeah, what do you think
I'm talking about, Paulie?

Please, come on.

It's not even fair, you know?

You don't understand. The joint is --

Oh, you run the joint.

Maybe I'll try to help you,
all right? Okay.

God bless you, Paulie.
I appreciate it. God bless you.

You always been fair with me. All right.

Henry: Now the guy's got Paulie as a partner.

Any problems, he goes to Paulie.

Trouble with the bill, he can go to Paulie.

Trouble with the cops,
deliveries, Tommy --

he can call Paulie.

But now the guy's got to come up

with Paulie's money every week,
no matter what.

"Business is bad? ---- you. Pay me.

"Oh, you had a fire? ---- you. Pay me.

"Place got hit by lightning, huh?

---- you. Pay me!"

Also, Paulie could do anything,

especially run up bills
on the joint's credit.

And why not? Nobody's gonna
pay for it, anyway.

And as soon as the deliveries
are made in the front door,

you move the stuff out the back
and sell it at a discount.

You take a $200 case of booze,
and you sell it for $100.

Doesn't matter. It's all profit.

And then, finally,
when there's nothing left...

freakin' shame.

...and you can't borrow
another buck from the bank

or buy another case of booze,
you bust the joint out.

You light a match.

I'm trying to make this freaking broad!

[ Stammering, fire alarm ringing ]

I don't understand you!
She's freaking beautiful!

Her freaking family, they live in the five towns.

You know, these Jew broads got a lot of money.

Maybe her family owns
the whole freaking block.

You're liable to wind up with
a big freaking score here, Henry.

See?! You with your mouth! See?

[ Tires screech ]

I had a meeting with Tuddy around 11:00,

and here I am, a backup guy for Tommy.

So how 'bout you, honey?
Did you have enough to eat?

Yeah. It was delicious.

Just watching my diet.

Why don't you let me watch
your figure for you?

I couldn't wait to get away.

I was ordering the dessert
when they were eating dinner.

When they were having coffee,
I was asking for our check.

I had business.

Have some coffee. It'll wake you up.

Joe? Can we have the check?

Tommy: Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

What are you doing?

I got to go.

Go where, Henry? We just got here.

I got that thing. I got to go.

Oh, I forgot.

Uh, wait a couple of minutes.
We'll all leave together, okay?

This way, we don't go out
like a bunch of hobos,

staggering out one at a time, you know?

Karen: I couldn't stand him.

I thought he was really obnoxious.

He kept fidgeting around.

You don't mind, do you?

It's very annoying.

Diane: What is that?
Tommy: It's anisette.

Good, huh? Mmm.

Yeah, you probably do a lot
better with manischewitz,

but it'd look funny
on my table. [ Laughs ]

Ready? Henry, lighten up.

We -- we just got here.
What are you doing?

Before it was even time to go home,

he was pushing me into the car
and then pulling me out.

It was ridiculous.

But Diane and Tommy made us promise

to meet them again on Friday night.

We agreed.

Of course,
when Friday night came around,

Henry stood me up.

I feel terrible.
I don't know where he is.

You know, he really liked you, too.

I mean, it's all he'd do, is talk
about her, you know?

We were a trio instead
of a double date that night.

I hope it's nothing serious.
That's what I'm worried about.

But I made Tommy
take me looking for him.

Whoa!

[ Tires screech ]

You got some nerve, standing me up.

Nobody does that to me.

Who the hell do you think you are --
Frankie Valli or some kind of big shot?!

Take it easy!
Slow down, slow down, all right?

I forgot. I thought it was next week.

It was Friday! It was this Friday!

And you agreed, so you're a liar!

We could talk about this,
all right? Take it easy.

Talk about it? Talk to you
after what you just did to me?

Forget it. I'm not talking
to you about anything.

Wait a second. I thought
you were gonna stand me up.

You looked bored.
You didn't say anything.

What do you expect, hmm?

Huh? Let me make it up to you. Karen.

I'll think about it.

Henry: I remember, she's
screaming on the street --

and I mean loud -- but she looked good.

I'll think about it.
It's gonna cost you, Hill.

I'm gonna make it up.
It's gonna cost you a lot.

She had these great eyes,
just like Liz Taylor's.

At least, that's what I thought.

Hello, Henry.

You ready? Yeah.

Come on.

Oh, no, wait a minute.

What?

Quick, you have to cover that cross.

If my mother sees that cross --

Woman: Karen?

Mom, I'd like you to meet
my friend Henry Hill.

How do you do?

Henry: Hi. Nice to meet you.

My daughter says that,
uh, you're half Jewish.

Um, just the good half.

[ Laughs ]

Thank you, sir.

I'll see you later. Thanks.

What are doing? You're leaving your car?

He watches the car for me.

It's easier than leaving it
at a garage and waiting.

It's a lot quicker that way.
You know what I mean?

Huh?

[ Speaking Italian ]

It was like he had two families.

The first time I was introduced
to all of them at once,

it was crazy.

Paulie and his brothers
had lots of sons and nephews.

And almost all of them
were named Peter or Paul.

This is Peter.

This is my brother's second cousin.

It was unbelievable.

I want you to meet Paulie Jr.,
my nephew.

And this is Petey.

There must have been
two dozen Peters and Pauls

at the wedding.

This is Marie.

Plus, they were all married
to girls named Marie.

She looks Italian.

Yeah, she looks Italian. You're right.

And they named
all their daughters Marie.

This is Marie. Hi, Marie.

And this is Pete. No, I mean, Paulie.

meeting everybody,

♪ Look out, look out, look out, look out! ♪

Well, we weren't married
to 9:00-to-5:00 guys,

but the first time
I realized how different

was when Mickey had a hostess party.

Karen, where are you from?

Lawrence.

Oh, yeah, Lawrence, out on the island.

That's nice.

I'm from Miami. You ever been there?

It's okay,

but it's like you died

What happened?

He was in an argument,
a lousy $10 card game.

He pulls out a gun. The gun goes off.

Some kid gets killed.

When the grandmother hears it
and finds out he's in jail,

she has a heart attack.

She drops dead right on the spot.

Now Jeanie has a husband
and a son in jail

and a mother in the funeral parlor.

Oh, come on.
Hey, you know Jeanie drinks.

Well, maybe she's depressed.

Depressed? Give me a break. She's drunk.

Aw, come on. As soon as something happens,

you automatically
make them out to be saints.

Karen: They had bad skin
and wore too much makeup.

I mean, they didn't look very good.

They looked beat up.

And the stuff they wore
was thrown together and cheap --

a lot of pantsuits and double-knits.

She doesn't wake up in the morning.

She spends her life in a nightgown.

That woman is no angel, believe me.

And they talked about
how rotten their kids were

and about beating them

with broom handles and leather belts,

but that the kids still
didn't pay any attention.

When Henry picked me up, I was dizzy.

I don't know! I don't know
if I could live like that!

God forbid, what would happen
if you had to go to prison?

Karen! [ Laughs ]

Mickey said that Jeanie's husband --

Do you know why Jeanie's husband
went to the can?

Because of Jeanie! Because
he wanted to get away from her!

That's why!

Let me tell you something.

Nobody goes to jail unless they want to,

unless they make themselves get caught.

They don't have things organized.

I know what I'm doing.

I got things organized with these guys.

You know who goes to jail?

Stupid stick-up men, that's who.

And you know why they get caught?

Because they fall asleep
in the getaway car, Karen.

Come on. Don't worry so much, sweetie.

Come here.

After a while, it got to be all normal.

None of it seemed like crimes.

It was more like Henry was enterprising

and that he and the guys were
making a few bucks hustling,

while the other guys
were sitting on their ----es,

waiting for handouts.

Our husbands weren't brain surgeons.

They were blue-collar guys.

The only way they could make
extra money, real extra money,

was to go out and cut a few corners.

Where's the strongbox, you varmint, you?!

Easy. Get out of here!

Easy, easy.

All right, all right.

Don't move. Don't move.
Take it easy! Take it easy.

Go ahead.

Frankie!

Frankie: Meet you guys at the diner.

Tommy: I'm riding shotgun! Ha ha!

Did you see him give it right over?!

Ha ha ha! Get back to the
hideout and split up the loot,

you sidewinder!

Yee-haa! Ha ha!

We were all so very close.

I mean, there were never
any outsiders around --

absolutely never.

And being together all the time

made everything
seem all the more normal.

Hello, Mrs. Hill, police.

I'm Detective Deacy.
This is Detective Silvestri.

We have a search warrant here for the premise.

Would you read and sign it?

Anywhere? Yeah, anywhere.

It's gonna take a while. We got
to go through everything, all right?

Thank you.

You boys want some coffee?

No coffee, no. Thanks, anyway.

All right. Just be careful.

We're just gonna go about
our business, all right?

I'll take the kitchen.

And there was always
a little harassment.

They always wanted to talk
to Henry about this or that.

They'd come in with their
subpoenas and warrants

and make me sign.

But mostly they were
just looking for a handout --

a few bucks to keep things quiet,

no matter what they found.

[ Whistling upbeat melody ]

I always asked them
if they wanted coffee.

Some of the wives, like Mickey Conway,

used to curse at them
and spit on the floor.

She used to spit on her own floor.

That never made any sense to me.

It was better to be polite
and call the lawyer.

we always went together --

His whole crew's

This is bad.

What are we gonna do with him?

We can't just dump him on the street.

I know a place upstate they'll never find him.

Come on, let's get
some more tablecloths.

I didn't want to get
blood on your floor.

♪ Where I want to be,

Henry, go open your trunk.

You got him? You got him?

Yeah.

Tommy: I'll pick up a shovel
at my mother's house.

She keeps a shovel
right around here somewhere.

Just keep quiet.
I don't want to wake her up.

Look who's here. Look who's here.

Hey, Ma, what are you doing up?

What are you doing? What happened?

No, no, nothing.
What happened to you?

I hit something out on the road.
Jimmy will tell you.

What happened, Jimmy?
No, no, no, no.

What happened? How are you?

I haven't seen you in so long.

What happened? I hate to see him that --

and you, too. How are you?

Good.

What are you doing up so late?

Well, he came in, youse came in,
and I figured, you know --

You know what time it is?
I'm so happy to see him.

Look, go inside. Make yourselves comfortable.

No, no, no. Go to sleep, go to sleep.

I'll make you something to eat.

No, I can't sleep.
Not while he's home, no.

I haven't seen him in
so long. I want to see him.

Youse go inside.

This stuff is great, but it's like lead.

So tell me, tell me, where you been?

I haven't seen you.

You haven't even called or anything.

Where have you been?

Well, Ma, I've been working nights.

And?

And, well, tonight we were out late.

We took a ride on the --
out to the country, and we hit one of those deers.

That's where the blood came from.

Jimmy told you before.

Anyway, that reminds me, Ma.
I need this knife.

I'm gonna take this. It's okay?

Okay, yeah.
Bring it back, though, you know.

Well, the poor thing, you know,

I hit him in his --
we hit the deer in his paw --

what do you call it?

The paw. The paw. His foot.

The hoof?

The hoof got caught in the grille,

and I got to hack it off.

Ohh.

Ma, it's a sin. You can't
leave it there, you know.

Anyway, I'll bring your knife
back after I do that. Anyway --

Delicious, delicious.

Thank you.

Why don't you get yourself a nice girl?

I get a nice one almost every night, Ma.

Yeah, but get yourself a girl
so you can settle down.

I settle down almost every night,

but then in the morning, I'm free.

[ Laughs ]

I love you. I want to be with you.

Why don't you settle down?

How is your friend Henry there?

Henry, what's the matter?
You don't talk too much.

Why don't you talk a little bit?
What are you quiet for?

You don't eat much. You don't talk much.

[ Chuckles ] I-I'm just listening.

Tommy: What's the matter?
Something wrong with you?

No.

You remind me of, when we were kids,

compares used to visit one another.

And there was this man,
he would never talk.

He would just sit there
all night and not say a word.

So they said to him,
"What's the matter, compare?

Don't you talk? Don't you say anything?"

He says, "What am I gonna say --
that my wife two-times me?"

So she says to him, "Shut up.
You're always talking."

[ Laughter ]

But in Italian,
it sounds much nicer, you know?

Cornuto content. That's it.

What's that mean?

Means he's content to be a jerk.

And he doesn't care who knows it.

Did Tommy ever tell you
about my painting?

No.

Look at this.

Ah, it's beautiful.

Tommy: I like this one.

One dog goes one way, and the
other dog goes the other way.

One is going east, and the
other one is going west. So what?

Then this guy's saying,
"What do you want from me?"

Guy's got a nice head of white hair.

Look how beautiful with the dog.
It looks the same.

Looks like somebody we know.

[ Laughter ]

Without the beard. No, it's him.

[ Laughs ]

It's him! Holy -- oh, Marone!

[ Thumping ]

[ Thumping continues ]

What the hell is that?

Henry: For most of the guys,
killings got to be accepted.

Murder was the only way
that everybody stayed in line.

You got out of line, you got whacked.

Everybody knew the rules.

But sometimes,

even if people didn't get
out of line, they got whacked.

I mean, hits just became
a habit for some of the guys.

Guys would get into arguments
over nothing,

and before you knew it,
one of them was dead.

I mean, they were shooting
each other all the time.

Shooting people was a normal thing.

It was no big deal.

We had a serious problem
with Billy Batts.

This was really a touchy thing.

Tommy had killed a made guy.

Batts was part of the Gambino crew

and was considered untouchable.

Before you could touch a made guy,

you had to have a good reason.

You had to have a sit-down,
and you better get an okay,

or you'd be the one who got whacked.

[ Indistinct conversations ]

How you been? Good to see you.

Vito, hey! How are you, buddy?

Henry: Saturday night was for wives,

but Friday night at the Copa
was always for the girlfriends.

[ Frankie speaking Italian ]

And last week we saw Sammy Davis Jr.

You got to see the show --
what a performer.

He does these impersonations.

I swear, you would think
it was the real people.

Oh, it's unbelievable.

I mean, you can see how
a white girl can fall for him.

What?

Well, I mean, not me.

I'm just saying, like, you could
see how some girls could,

you know, like that Swedish girl.

In other words, you condone that stuff?

Take it easy. [ Laughs ]

Henry --
I know, I know, I know.

I just want to make sure
I don't wind up kissing

freakin' Nat King Cole over here.

No, I'm not talking about me.
I'm just saying, you know,

you can see how a girl could.

You know, he's got personality.

Oh, of course. Personality?

I understand perfectly
what you're saying,

but you have to watch out
sometimes how you say things.

You know, people get
the wrong impression.

He was talented, you know.
He just was unbelievable.

Why don't you just leave it alone now?

I mean, I understand what you said.

You know, the guy's talented.

Leave it at that. He's very talented.

each other to the lions
down there, because the
guy gave the money right up.

I swear I'll get the money.

And we got to spend the rest
of the weekend at the track.

Yeah. They mean business.

Then, I couldn't believe what happened.

When we got home,
we were all over the newspaper.

At first, I didn't even know
why we got picked up,
then I found out
that the guy we roughed up
turned out to have a sister
working as a typist for the FBI.

Who could believe it?

She gave up everybody --
Jimmy, me, even her brother.

Woman: They come after
all of us, these friends of his.

Henry: It took the jury six hours
to bring us in guilty.

The judge gave Jimmy and me 10 years
like he was giving away candy.

...10 years in a federal penitentiary.

You will now be turned over
to the United States
Attorney General's office.

[ Bobby Darin's "Beyond the Sea" plays ]

In prison,
dinner was always a big thing.

We had a pasta course,
and then we had a meat or a fish.

Paulie did the prep work.

He was doing a year for contempt,
and he had this wonderful
system for doing the garlic.

He used a razor,
and he used to slice it so thin
that it used to liquefy in
the pan with just a little oil.

It was a very good system.

Vinnie was in charge
of the tomato sauce.

Ah, got the smell.

Got three kinds of meat
in the meatballs.

Man: What'd you put in it?

Got veal, beef, and pork.

Ah, good, but you got to have the pork.

That's the flavor.

I felt he used too many onions,
but it was still a very good sauce.

Vinnie, don't put too many
onions in the sauce.

I didn't put too much onions, Paul.

I put three small onions --
that's all I did.

Three onions?

How many cans of tomatoes
you put in there?

I put two cans, two big cans.

Johnny Dio did the meat.

We didn't have a broiler, so
Johnny did everything in pans.

It used to smell up the joint
something awful,
and the hacks used to die,
but he still cooked a great steak.

Vinnie, how do you like yours?

Rare -- medium-rare.

Medium-rare. Hmm, an aristocrat.

You know, when you think of prison...

Here's your lobsters.

...you get pictures in your
mind of all those old movies
with rows and rows of guys behind bars.

But it wasn't like that for wiseguys.

It really wasn't that bad,
excepting that I missed Jimmy.

He was doing his time in Atlanta.

Vinnie, give me two steaks
while you're in there.

All right, John.

I mean, everybody else in
the joint was doing real time,
all mixed together, living like pigs,
but we lived alone.

I mean, we owned the joint.

Baseball-batted them two --
you couldn't recognize 'em.

Good, they deserved it.

Even the hacks we couldn't bribe
would never rat on the guys that we did.

Sorry it took so long.

That skinny guard's getting
to be a real pain in the neck.

We're gonna have to do
something about that.

Ah, I took care of him.

All right. What'd you bring?

All right, uh, some bread.

Good. Fresh.

Vinnie, I got your peppers and onions.

Salami, prosciutto, a lot of cheese --

Come on, come on. What else?

Scotch. Nice.

Here's some red wine.

Okay, now we can eat.

I got some white, too.
Give me the white, too.

Beautiful. Okay, boys, let's eat.

Come on. It's ready, Vinnie.

Here's some more bread.

Tomorrow we eat sandwiches.

You got to go on a diet, Vinnie.

You know what he told me?

He told me to take my kids
down to the police station

and get on welfare.

Karen, it's gonna be okay.

Even Paulie, since he got out,
I never see him.

I never see anybody anymore.
It's only you and me.

That's what happens when you go away.

I've told you that. We're on our own.

Forget everybody else. Forget Paulie.

As long as he's on parole,

he doesn't want anybody doing anything.

Shh, shh, shh, shh.

I can't do this.

Yes, you can, Karen. Listen to me.

All I need from you is
to keep bringing me this stuff.

I got a guy in here from Pittsburgh

who's gonna help me move it.

Believe me, in a month,
we're gonna be fine. We won't need anybody.

I'm afraid.

I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.

What'd I just say?
Don't worry about him.

He is not helping us out.

Is he putting any food on the table?

We've got to help each other.

We just got to -- listen.

We got to be really,
really careful while we do it.

I don't want to hear a word
about her anymore, Henry.

Never.

Daddy!

Oh, we missed you.

You here to stay?

Did you see our pictures?

I did the one with the house
and the rainbow.

And I did the sun.

My chorus concert is in two weeks.

Are you coming?

Karen, get packed.
We're moving out of here.

With what?
Don't worry with what.

You just start looking
for a new house, okay?

I got to go to Pittsburgh
in the morning.

Those guys out there,
they owe me 15 grand.

We'll be all right.
I got things lined up.

Pittsburgh? You have to go see
your parole officer tomorrow.

Karen, don't worry about it.
Everything's gonna be fine.

Who wants to go to Uncle Paulie's?

Me!

Are you hungry?

Yeah!

Paulie: No, he's an arrogant guy.

He doesn't do the right thing.

You did what you had to do.

I'm talking about now --
from now, here and now.

Paulie, why would I want to
get into that?

Don't make a jerk out of me.
Just don't do it.

Just don't do it.

Now, I want to talk to you about Jimmy.

You got to watch out for him.

He's a good earner,

but he's wild, takes too many chances.

No, I know that. I know Jimmy.

You think I would
take chances like Jimmy?

And Tommy -- he's a good kid, too.

But he's crazy. He's a cowboy.
He's got too much to prove.

No, I know.

Listen to me. I ain't gonna
get ----ed like Gribbs.

You understand? Gribbs is 70 years old,

and the freaking guy's
gonna die in prison.

I don't need that.

So I'm warning everybody -- everybody.

It could be my son. It could be anybody.

Gribbs got 20 years
just for saying hello

to some fool who goes sneaking
behind his back selling junk.

I don't need that.
Ain't gonna happen to me.

You understand? Uh-huh.

You know that you're only out
early 'cause I got you a job?

Yeah.

And you see anybody
fooling around with this junk,

more than she mixed,

I could see that this was
a really good business.

I made $12,000 in my second week.

for what turned out to be

the biggest heist in American history,

the Lufthansa heist.

had to round up the workers.

Johnny Roastbeef
had to keep them all tied up

What he was supposed to do
was steal the panel truck

and afterwards, compact it by

Right away, I knew he didn't want them,

and I knew I was gonna
get stuck for the money.

I only bought the ---- guns
because he wanted them,

and now he didn't want them.

What good are these
things? None of them fit.

What's the matter with you?

What, do you want me to pay for this?

I'm not paying for it.

I didn't say a thing.

I'll take them back.

Now, I knew my Pittsburgh guys
always wanted guns.

And since I was gonna see them
later in the afternoon

to pick up a delivery,

I was pretty sure I'd get my money back.

Oh, my God.

When I finally got there at the
hospital to pick up Michael,

his doctor wanted to put me in bed.

Wait a minute. What happened to you?

Uh, nothing.

I just almost got into
an accident right now,

driving over here.

I told him about the accident,

and I said I was partying all night.

No, I'm fine, Doc.

Come on, get over here.

Doc, I'm fine.

Let me check you out. Come on.

He took mercy on me.

He gave me 10 milligrams

Now, my plan was to drop off
my brother at the house

and pick up Karen.

Henry: There it is.
You see that, Michael?

See that helicopter? See it right there?
Right in front of us there.

Where? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

I think it's been following me all morning.

What are you, nuts?

I'm telling you.

I don't know what's going on.

It's the third time I've seen it.

I went to the hospital.
I started out to get you.

I had to stop somewhere,
make a couple stops.

What are you, nuts?

I see it every time.

I've been all over town, and that thing,

I've seen it all day.

See, I was cooking dinner that night,

and I had to start braising the beef,

pork butt, and veal shanks
for the tomato sauce.

I'm gonna make 'em all.
I'm gonna make all this meat.

It was Michael's favorite.

I was making ziti with the meat gravy,

and I'm planning to roast
some peppers over the flames,

and I was gonna put on some string beans

with some olive oil and garlic,

and I had some beautiful cutlets

that were cut just right

that I was gonna fry up before
dinner just as an appetizer.

So I was home for about an hour.

Now, my plan was to start
the dinner early

so Karen and I could unload the guns

that Jimmy didn't want
and then get the package

for Lois to take to Atlanta
for her trip later that night.

Who's been carving their
initials in the tomatoes?

Now, I kept looking out the window,

and I saw that the helicopter was gone.

Karen? Michael, keep an eye
on the sauce, all right?

Stay here with your
Uncle Michael, all right?

All right. I'll see you later.

So I asked my brother Michael
to watch the sauce,

and Karen and I started out.

Oh, God. Oh, God, I see it.

What? I see it.

----! Yep, that's it. There it is.

Come on. We got to get to your mother's.

See? I told you.

It's funny. Okay? It's funny.

It's not the end of the world.

Just -- we're going to your mother's.

No, that's all right.
I'll show you helicopters.

No, I've seen enough helicopters
for one day, thank you.

I'll show you helicopters.

My plan was, I had to get home
and get the package ready

for Lois to take on her trip.

Also, I had to get to Sandy's house

to give the package a whack
with quinine.

Plus, I knew Sandy
was gonna get on my back.

Then I had the cooking
to finish at home,

and I had to get Lois
ready for her trip.

Sandy.

Pain in the ----. Yeah?

Sandy: Babe, when are you coming over?

I'll be there in about an hour.

You're staying tonight, right?

I can't, I can't. I got my brother tonight.

Oh, Henry --

Come on, stop, stop, stop.
We'll talk about it later, okay?

Whatever. Bye.

Goodbye.

[ Rotary phone dialing ]

[ Telephone rings ]

Hello?

Hey, it's me. You ready?

Yeah.

Listen, tell Michael not
to let the sauce stick,

to keep stirring it.

Henry says don't let the sauce stick.

I'm stirring it.

Listen, you know what to do?
Yeah, yeah.

Don't "Yeah, yeah" me, Lois!
This is important.

Now, make sure you leave the
house when you make the call.

You understand me? You hear me?

Call from an outside line. I mean it.

You must think I'm dumb.
What are you bugging me for?

I know what to do.

Hey, you little hick!
Just make sure you do it.

I mean what --
You can be such a pain.

Hey! Just do it!

Okay.

Unbelievable.

All of them -- every girl in my life.

What'd he say?

Nothing.

So what does she do
after she hangs up with me?

After everything I told her?

After all her "Yeah, yeah, yeah"?

She picks up the phone
and calls from the house.

Now, if anybody was listening,
they'd know everything.

They'd know that a package
was leaving from my house,

and they'd even have the time
and the flight number,

thanks to her.

As soon as I got home,
I started cooking.

I had a few hours until Lois' flight.

I told my brother
to keep an eye on the stove.

All day long, the poor guy's
been watching helicopters
and tomato sauce.

You see, I had to drive over
to Sandy's place,

mix the stuff once,
and then get back to the gravy.

I'm talking to you.

You don't want to say a word to me,

you don't have to say anything.

25 years, pal.
That's what you're gonna do.

Let's see how much of a good guy
you're gonna be then.

All day I thought the guys
in the helicopter

were just local cops
busting my chops over Lufthansa.

But they turned out to be narcs.

They'd been on me a month --
phone taps, surveillance, everything.

You know the boys. How you doing, boys?

All the pals are here.

You don't want to talk to me,

you're gonna have a problem all night.

What's your problem?

[ Laughs ]

Bye-bye, ----head.

See you in Attica, ----.

Karen: I spoke to Jimmy.

He offered to give me some money.

He just wants to know what's happening.

He just wants to talk to you.

I told you. I got to get out of here

and straighten out
everything with Paulie,

or else I'm dead, Karen.

Then you're better off staying in here.

Karen, they could whack
me in here just as easy

as they can outside --
maybe even easier.

They're all afraid
I'm gonna rat them out.

People are already walking away from me.

I'm dead in here. You got to get me out.

Karen finally got her mother
to put her house up for my bail,

and I was out.

I remember I had this feeling

I was gonna get killed
right outside the jail.

I knew Paulie was still ticked at me,

and he's such a hothead.

And I was worried about Jimmy.

See, Jimmy knew if Paulie found out

he was in the drug deals with me,

Paulie would have Jimmy whacked
even before me.

This is the bad time.

I didn't feel safe until I got home.

Karen.

So now my plan was to stay alive

long enough to sell off the
dope that the cops never found

and then disappear for a while

until I can get things straightened out.

Karen!

Where's the stuff that I left, Karen?

I flushed it down the toilet.

You what?!

What was I supposed to do?

They were all over the house.

Karen, that was worth $60,000!

I need that money! That's all we got!

What was I supposed to do?

They had a search warrant!
They were in everything!

That's all the money that we had, Karen!

I was depending on that!
Why did you do that?

I had to! They were gonna find it!

What, Karen?! They would
have never found it!

They would have found it,
I swear to you, Henry!

I swear, Henry,
they would have found it!

[ Sobbing ] Oh, no!

Why did you do that?! Why?!

They would have found it.
I swear to you.

Why did you do that, Karen?

Oh, my God!

I had to do it.

Oh, my God!

Oh, God.

Henry.

[ Both sobbing ]

No! No!

[ Horn honking ]

[ Tires screeching ]

Henry: Paulie, I'm really sorry.

I don't know what else to say.

I know I ----ed up.

----ed up? Yeah, you ----ed up.

You know?

But I'm all right now.

You know, I can be trusted now, Paulie.

I'm clean. On my kids, I'm clean.

You looked in my eyes, you lied to me.

You treated me like a freaking jerk,

like I was never nothing to you.

Paulie, after what you said,
I couldn't come to you.

You know, I was -- I was ashamed.

I'm -- I'm ashamed now.

But I got nowhere else to go, Paulie.

You're all I've got,

and I really, really need your help.

I really do.

Take this.

[ Crying ]

Now I got to turn my back on you.

[ Exhales sharply ]

Okay.

[ Indistinct conversations ]

3,200 bucks. That's what he gave me.

3,200 bucks for a lifetime.

It wasn't even enough
to pay for the coffin.

We got to get out.

Karen: I don't want to run.

What am I supposed to do,

just pick up and
leave everything, go hiding?

I don't want to do that, Henry.
Is that what you want?

Karen, if we stay around here,
we're dead.

You got it? We're dead!

They're right.

You took too much of that stuff.
You're totally paranoid.

Good. Thanks.

How's he doing?

He's okay. Good.

I sobered him up.

Good, good.

Good, good. Very good. Glad to hear it.

You know what kind of questions
they been asking him? Did he tell you?
Jimmy, I don't know.

I mean, I got my mind
on so many other things.

I got no money. The --

The girls are old enough
to read the newspapers.

Tell him he's got to call me, okay?

As soon as you talk to him,
he's got to call me.

We got to work on this whole thing.

It's very important.

He doesn't know I came
down here to see you.

You know, it's like he's crazy.

Take this for now.
It's a couple thousand.

Thanks, Jimmy.

Don't worry, honey.
Everything's gonna be all right.

Listen, I got some beautiful
Dior dresses.

You want to have 'em?

Pick out a few for yourself, huh?

For my mom.

Yeah, whatever. Take a few.

No, no, it's over here.

See, the store on the corner.

It's swag, so I got it down the corner.

Okay?

Go ahead, sweetheart. I'll see you.

Thanks, Jimmy.

Don't worry. I'll try.

All right? Don't forget.
He's got to call me.

All right.

Over here?

Right down there.

Yeah.

No, no, it's right over there.
Right on the corner.

Yeah, it's over there. Right there.

[ Indistinct conversation ]

Shh, shh.

Just be quiet.

Jimmy: No. No, no, no, no.

Hey, go ahead! It's right in there.

No, Jimmy! I'm in a hurry!

My mom's watching the kids!
I got to get home!

I'll come back later!

[ Engine turns over ]

[ Tires screeching ]

[ Tires screech ]

Karen? Karen?

[ Crying ]

What happened? Karen?

Nothing.

What happened?

I just got scared.

You got the keys?

What happened, Karen?

I just got scared, Henry.
It's o-- it's okay.

You all right? Yeah.

[ Sniffles ]

[ Sobbing ]

Shh.

Henry: If you're part of a crew,

nobody ever tells you that
they're going to kill you.

Doesn't happen that way.

There aren't any arguments
or curses like in the movies.

See, your murderers come with smiles.

They come as your friends,

the people who have cared
for you all of your life,

and they always seem to come at a time

when you're at your weakest
and most in need of their help.

So I met Jimmy in
a crowded place we both knew.

I got there 15 minutes early,

and I saw that Jimmy was already there.

He took the booth near the window

so he could see everyone
who drove up to the restaurant.

He wanted to make sure I wasn't tailed.

He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing.

On the surface, of course,

everything was supposed to be fine.

We were supposed to be
discussing my case.

But I had the feeling
Jimmy was trying to sense

whether I was gonna rat him out
to save my neck.

I been telling you your whole life --

don't talk on the phone, right?

Now you understand, huh?

But it's gonna be okay.

I think you got a good chance
of beating the case.

Yeah.

Well, you know that kid, you know,
from the city we're talking about?

You know who I'm talking about.

Yeah.

Well, the kid turned out to be a rat.

As soon as he got pinched,
he ratted everybody out.

He ratted youse all out.

But I know where he is. He's hiding now.

He's -- you know, he's...

Know what I'm saying?

Would you have a problem

going with Anthony on vacation,
you know, take care of that?

Mnh-mnh.

No, not at all.

That way they got nothing, huh?

Jimmy had never asked me
to whack somebody before.

But now he's asking me
to go down to Florida

and do a hit with Anthony.

That's when I knew

I would never have come back
from Florida alive.

[ Clears throat ]

You know what?

I think I'll have an English muffin.

And wherever you move me --

I asked you once, and I'm gonna tell you again,

I don't want to go
any place that's cold.

You really don't have
a choice in that matter.

Ed, come on.

Just whoever controls it --
just no place cold, all right?

Do that for me. I'm trying to --

He's bronchial. That's why.

Well, if he's legitimately bronchial,
we'll take that into consideration.

I'm legitimately bronchial.

I would like to go
someplace that's not cold.

Okay, can I ask you some questions here?

What about my parents?

What about them?

Am I gonna see them?
Am I gonna talk to them?

I mean, don't I have
some kind of contact with them?

No.

No, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

You mean to tell me that --
God forbid, something happens
to my parents and they get sick,

I can't go and see them?

Maybe something can be
worked out if they're sick,

if there's some extraordinary
set of circumstances.

Maybe something can be worked out.

I can't do this.
I can't do this, Henry. I can't.

[ Voice breaking ] I can't leave my parents.

Excuse me.

Karen, I told you before. If you --

I'm not gonna do this unless
you and the kids come with me.

I-I can't do it without you, okay?

So you do whatever, but -- that's it.

You need Henry.
You don't need me, right?

That's right.

And frankly, I don't care
whether you go or not.

If it's gonna make him
a happier witness, a better witness,
I'd like you to be with him.

They want Henry. They don't want me.

But Henry's gonna be in
the witness protection program.

They're not gonna be able to get to him.

The only way they can get to him

is by getting to you,
getting to your kids.

If he goes into the program,
forget about it.

You're in a great deal of danger.

I don't know anything.

Come on, you don't know anything.

Don't give me the babe-in-the-woods

routine, Karen.

I've listened to those wiretaps,

and I've heard you on the telephone.

You're talking about cocaine.

Conversation after conversation,

you're talking to Henry on the phone.

[ Sirens, indistinct conversations ]

It doesn't matter,
because whether he goes to jail

or whether he stays on the
street and he beats the case,

he's a dead man.

He knows it, and you know it.

What about the kids, with school?

Will they get left back?
I mean, what goes on?

Why don't you guys
go down to Wall Street

and get some real crooks?

Whoever sold you those suits
had a wonderful sense of humor.

What it comes down to, Karen,

is we're basically your only salvation.

We're gonna save your life,
we're gonna save his life,

and we're gonna keep you out of jail.

[ Sighs ]

Man: Mr. Hill, this morning,

you told the members of this jury about your background.

It was easy for all of us to disappear.

My house was in my mother-in-law's name.

My cars were registered to my wife.

My social security cards and
driver's licenses were phonies.

I never voted. I never paid taxes.

My birth certificate
and my arrest sheet --

that's all you'd ever have
to know I was alive.

Do you see him here
in the courtroom today?

Yes.

Can you please point him out
for the members of the jury?

Your Honor, please let the record reflect

that Mr. Hill has identified
the defendant James Conway.

Mr. Hill, do you also know a man
by the name of Paul Cicero?

Yes.

Do you see him here
in the courtroom today?

Yes.

Can you point him out
for the members of the jury?

Your Honor, let the record reflect

that Mr. Hill has identified
the defendant Paul Cicero.

Your Honor, I have a document
that I'd like to have marked...

See, the hardest thing for me
was leaving the life.

I still love the life.

I mean, we were treated like
movie stars with muscle.

We had it all, just for the asking.

Our wives, mothers, kids,
everybody rode along.

I had paper bags filled with
jewelry stashed in the kitchen.

I had a sugar bowl full of coke
next to the bed.

People call them rats
'cause a rat will do

anything to survive.

Isn't that right, Mr. Hill?

Objection!

Judge: Objection sustained.

Look, I don't know nothing
about being a rat.

Mr. Hill, you know everything
about being a rat.

Man: Objection, Your Honor!

Anything I wanted
was a phone call away --

free cars,

the keys to a dozen hideout
flats all over the city.

I'd bet 20, 30 grand over a weekend,

and then I'd either
blow the winnings in a week

or go to the sharks
to pay back the bookies.

It didn't matter.
It didn't mean anything.

When I was broke, I would go out
and rob some more.

We ran everything. We paid off cops.

We paid off lawyers. We paid off judges.

Everybody had their hands out.

Everything was for the taking.

And now it's all over.

And that's the hardest part.

Today, everything is different.

There's no action.

I have to wait around
like everyone else.

Can't even get decent food.

Right after I got here,

I ordered some spaghetti
with marinara sauce,

and I got egg noodles and ketchup.

I'm an average nobody.

I get to live the rest
of my life like a schnook.
