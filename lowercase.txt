You better pull over and see.

No, no, no, Tommy.

He's still alive.

Die, you mother( … )er. Die.

Look at my ( … )in' eyes!

Die!

(GUNSHOTS)

As far back as I can remember,

I always wanted to be a gangster.

Even before I first wandered into
the cab stand for an after-school job,

I knew I wanted to be a part of them.

It was there that I knew
that I belonged.

I mean, to me, it meant being somebody

in a neighborhood that was full of nobodies.

They weren't like anybody else.

I mean, they did whatever they wanted.

They double-parked in front of a hydrant.

Nobody ever gave them a ticket.

In the summer when
they played cards all night,

nobody ever called the cops.

MAN: Good, good, good.

Good to see you, Frankie.

Hey, Dr. Dan, how you doing? How are ya?

Hey, Tuddy.

Tony Stacks. How are ya?

♪ Or will I go from rags to riches? ♪

Tuddy Cicero.

Minghia, could this be the Canarsie kid?

Hello, Tuddy. How are you?

Good, good.

Tuddy.

Minghia, Tuddy.

Tuddy ran the cab stand

and the Bella Vista Pizzeria and a few
other places for his brother Paul

who was the boss over everybody
in the neighborhood.

Hello, Paulie.

Hey, Paulie.

Paulie might've moved slow...

but it was only because Paulie
didn't have to move for anybody.

It's your fault.

-You started it.
-I started it? It's your fault.

Hey, Junior, here.

At first my parents loved

that I found a job across
the street from the house.

My father, who was Irish,

was sent to work at the age of 11.

And he liked that I got myself a job.

He always used to say that
American kids were spoiled lazy.

-Bye, Dad.
-Bye. Take your lunch.

See you, Mikey.

Bye, Henry.

Henry, watch how you cross!

And bring back milk!

And my mother was happy

after she found out that the Ciceros

came from the same part
of Sicily as she did.

I mean, to my mother, that was
the answer to all her prayers.

♪ Whoa-o-o-oh ♪

I was the luckiest kid in the world.

I could go anywhere. I could do anything.

I knew everybody, and everybody knew me.

Wiseguys would pull up,

and Tuddy would toss me their keys

and let me park their Cadillacs.

I mean, here I am, this little kid.

I can't even see over the steering wheel,

and I'm parking Cadillacs.

But it wasn't too long before
my parents changed their minds

about my job at the cab stand.

This is for your mother and sister.

For them, the cab stand was
supposed to be a part-time job,

but for me, it was definitely full-time.

That's all I wanted to do.

See, people like my father
could never understand,

but I was a part of something.

I belonged.
I was treated like a grown-up.

All right, look, Henry, tell him 519.

Every day I was learning to score.

A dollar here, a dollar there.

I was living in a fantasy.

TUDDY: ( … ) his mother and his father.

So did you have a good day
at school today?

-And my father was always pissed off.
-Learned a lot?

He was pissed that he made
such lousy money,

he was pissed that
my kid brother Michael
was in a wheelchair, he was pissed

that there were seven of us

living in such a tiny house.

Why don't you tell me about this.

It's a letter from school.

It says you haven't
been there in months.

In months!

You think you're so smart?

You'll grow up to be a bum!

You want to grow up to be a bum?

But after a while, he was mostly pissed

because I hung around the cab stand.

He knew what went on at that cab stand,

and every once in a while,
I'd have to take a beating.

But by then I didn't care.

The way I saw it,

everybody takes a beating sometime.

No, don't! No!

I can't make any more deliveries.

What do you mean you can't make
any more deliveries?

You're gonna ( … ) everything up.

My dad said he's gonna kill me. Look.

Come on with me.

MAN: Is that him there, kid?

No.

How about him?

Nope.

That's the guy.

Get him.

Excuse me.

Yeah?

( … )bag.

-Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
-Come here, you piece of ( … ).

Know this kid? Answer.

Yeah.

You know where he lives?

-Yeah.
-Deliver mail to his house? Answer.

Yeah.

Well, from now on,

any letter from that school
to that kid's house

comes directly here, you understand?

-Yeah.
-If another letter from that school

goes to that kid's house,

in the ( … )in' oven
you're gonna go, headfirst!

That was it.

No more letters from truant officers,

no more letters from school.

In fact, no more letters from anybody.

Finally, after a couple of weeks,

my mother had to go
to the post office and complain.

How could I go back to school after that

and pledge allegiance to the flag

and sit through good government bull( … )?

Paulie hated phones.

He wouldn't have one in his house.

Mikey called. You want me
to call him back?

All right, make the call. Go ahead.

He used to get all his calls secondhand.

Then you'd have to call the people back

from an outside phone.

Did you get a nickel? Get him on the phone for me.

There were guys, that's all they did,

all day long, was take care
of Paulie's phone calls.

Yeah, yeah. All right. Thanks.

Just like this.

What a dog.

For a guy who moved all day long,

Paulie didn't talk to six people.

If there was a union problem
or, say, a beef in the numbers,

then only the top guys
can meet with Paulie

to discuss the problem.

Everything was one-on-one.
Paulie hated conferences.

He didn't want anybody
hearing what he said,

and he didn't want anybody listening

to what he was being told.

Hundreds of guys depended on Paulie,

and he got a piece
of everything they made.

It was tribute just like
in the old country except they were
doing it here in America.

All they got from Paulie

was protection from other guys
looking to rip them off.

And that's what it's all about.

That's what the FBI
could never understand,

that what Paulie
and the organization does

is offer protection for people
who can't go to the cops.

That's it. That's all it is.

They're like the police
department for wiseguys.

(GLASS SHATTERS)

People looked at me differently.

I mean, they knew I was with somebody.

I didn't have to wait
in line at the bakery

on Sunday mornings anymore
for fresh bread.

The owner knew who I was with,

and he'd come from around the counter.

No matter how many people were waiting,

I was taken care of first.

Our neighbors didn't park
in our driveway anymore,

even though we didn't have a car.

At 13, I was making more money
than most of the grown-ups

in the neighborhood.

I mean, I had more money
than I could spend. I had it all.

One day...

One day, some of the kids
from the neighborhood

carried my mother's groceries
all the way home.

You know why?

It was out of respect.

Hi, Mom. What do you think?

Look at my shoes. Aren't they great?

My God...you look like a gangster.

They shot me! Help!

Help! They shot me!

(ITALIAN OPERA PLAYING)

Henry, shut the door. Shut the door!

That was the first time
I had ever seen anyone shot.

Jesus! Can't have that in here.

Jesus Christ. I can't--
I can't have that in this joint.

I remember feeling bad about the guy,

but I also remember feeling
that maybe Tuddy was right.

I knew Paulie didn't want
anybody dying in the building.

You're a real jerk.

You wasted eight
( … )in' aprons on this guy.

I don't know what
the hell's wrong with you.

I got to toughen this kid up.

It was a glorious time,

and wiseguys were all over the place.

It was before Apalachin
and before Crazy Joe

decided to take on a boss
and start a war.

It was when I met the world.

It was when I first met Jimmy Conway.

He couldn't have been more than
28 or 29 at the time,

but he was already a legend.

Now, he'd walk in the door,

and everybody who worked
the room just went wild.

He'd give the doorman a hundred
just for opening the door.

He'd shove hundreds in
the pockets of the dealers

and all the guys that ran the games.

The bartender got a hundred

just for keeping the ice cubes cold.

The Irishman is here
to take all you guineas' money.

PAULIE: You want a drink?

I'll have the seven and seven.

♪ Well, now, they often call me Speedo ♪

Jimmy, I'd like you
to meet the kid Henry.

How you doing? Pleasure.

Thank you.

All right. Keep it coming.

See, Jimmy was one of the most
feared guys in the city.

He was first locked up at 11,

and he was doing hits for
mob bosses when he was 16.

See, hits never bothered Jimmy.

It was business.

But what Jimmy really loved to do...

What he really loved to do was steal.

I mean, he actually enjoyed it.

Jimmy was the kind of guy
who rooted for the bad guys

in the movies.

Give me your wallet.

You might know who we are,

but we know who you are, you understand?

He was one of the city's

biggest hijackers of booze, cigarettes,

razor blades, shrimp, and lobsters.

Shrimp and lobsters were best.

They went really fast.

And almost all of them were gimmies.

I mean, they just
gave it up, no problem.

They called him Jimmy the Gent.

Tommy, help the lady.

The drivers loved him.

They used to tip him off
about the really good loads,

and of course everybody got a piece.

Thanks, Jimmy. I'll be back
with the rest later.

Okay. See you later.

Henry, come here.

Say hello to Tommy.

Hey. How you doin', Hendry?

Youse are gonna be workin' together.

-Okay? Help him. Okay.
-All right. Sounds good.

Hey, Jimmy, you got anything good?

And when the cops, they assigned
a whole army to stop Jimmy,

what did he do?

How youse doin'? Joe, Rich.

-He made 'em partners.
-Okay.

Jimmy, I'd complain, but who'd listen?

Give me one Pall Mall.

I'll take two Luckies.

Two Luckies.

Here you go, Henry.
Thanks a lot.

-Here you go.
-Thanks. What do you need?

-One Pall Mall.
-One Pall Mall. Here you go.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, what
do you think you're doing?

No, it's all right.

You got permission from your mother?

How many cartons you need?

Where'd you get those cigarettes?

Get him outta here.

-It's okay.
-It's not okay.

No. No, you don't understand!

No, you don't understand.
Store's closed.

(ITALIAN OPERA PLAYING)

Henry got pinched.

Where?

By the factory
for selling cigarettes and...

JUDGE: Henry Hill.

The people of the state
of New York versus Henry Hill.

Docket number 704162.

Uh, yes, sir. That's me.

Come over here.

Just stand right there.

Now, stay there.

Counselor, proceed.

Hey, Jimmy.

Congratulations.

Here's your graduation preset.

What for? I got pinched.

Everybody gets pinched,
but you did it right.

You told 'em nothin',
and they got nothin'.

I thought you'd be mad.

I'm not mad at you. I'm proud of you.

You took your first pinch like a man,

and you learned the two
greatest things in life.

What?

Look at me.

Never rat on your friends...

and always keep your mouth shut.

MAN: Hey, here he is! Here he is!

Oh, you broke your cherry!

(ALL CHEERING)

Henry!

Congratulations, kid!

By the time I grew up,
there was 30 billion a year

in cargo moving through Idlewild Airport,

and believe me, we tried
to steal every bit of it.

See, you gotta understand,
we grew up near the airport.

It belonged to Paulie.

And we had friends and relatives
who worked all over the place,

and they would tip us off
about what was coming in

and what was moving out.

And if any of the truckers
or airlines gave us any trouble,

Paulie had his union people
scare them with a strike.

It was beautiful.

It was an even bigger
moneymaker than numbers,

and Jimmy was in charge of it all.

Whenever we needed money,
we'd rob the airport.

To us, it was better than Citibank.

-Come on, come on! Got a phone?
-Phone's over there.

Two n( … )s just stole my truck.

Can you believe that ( … )? Huh?

Can you ( … )in' believe that?

There was Jimmy and Tommy and me,

and there was Anthony Stabile.

Hey, how are you doin'?

-Frankie Carbone.
-Che si dice? Come se va?

Ci vediamo, eh?

And then there was
Mo Black's brother Fat Andy.

How are you doin', buddy?

And his guys, Frankie the Wop...

Are you staying out of trouble?

-Freddy No Nose...
-Hey, pal, how you doin'?

And then there was Pete the Killer,

who was Sally Balls's brother.

Don't worry, I took care of that thing for ya.

Then you had Nickey Eyes...

What's up, guy?

...and Mikey Franzese.

I saw that guy. Yeah, I wanna see him.

And Jimmy Two Times,
who got that nickname

because he said
everything twice, like...

I'm gonna go get the papers,
get the papers.

HENRY: Vinnie, they're
gonna be out of style

by the time you get this thing
going. Come on, lift it up.

Watch the wall.

Come on. Come on, Vinnie.

We got coats.

What is this? Coats?

Henry. I need suits, Henry, not coats.

Suits are, uh, coming Thursday.

I know, but this is the middle
of the ( … )in' summer.

What am I gonna do with fur coats?

You don't want furs,
I'll take the furs away.

No. Don't take 'em away. I want 'em.

We'll hang 'em in the freezer
with the meat. How's that?

For us, to live any other way was nuts.

To us, those goody-good people
who worked ( … )ty jobs

for bum paychecks and who took
the subway to work every day,

worried about their bills, were dead.

They were suckers. They had no balls.

If we wanted something, we just took it.

If anyone complained twice,
they got hit so bad,

believe me, they never complained again.

It was just all routine.
You didn't even think about it.

FRANKIE: I can never hit that number.

TOMMY: Hey, Frankie, Frankie, Frankie,

what the ( … ) does 528
have to do with 460?

I can't believe this guy.

( … )in' 528 ain't even close to 460.

What the ( … ) has that got
to do with anything?

FRANKIE: I've been playin'
that number for three years now.

-Hey, Henry.
-How you doin'?

Piece of cake. It's all there.

Don't worry about the alarms.

Just gotta find a way to get the key.

-No problem, right?
-I'll take care of it.

Hey, guys, how you doing?
It's good to see you.

Tell him what you
were telling me now, Frenchy.

Too good to be true.

Ha-ha.

Big score coming from Air France.

I mean, like, bags of money
like this comin' in, okay?

From tourists and American servicemen

who changed their money over
into French money, sent it back here.

Shh. Calm down.

Okay. It's beautiful.

It's totally, totally untraceable, okay?

The only problem is gettin' a key,

but I got something worked out.

Me and Frenchy and this ( … )ing guy.

He's just a citizen, so whatever.

Yeah, the guy's a piece of work.
Now, if I'm right,

there could be, like, a half
a mil comin' in, all cash.

And he said the best time
is probably over the weekend.

-Oh, yeah.
-So maybe Saturday night...

Oh, they got the Jewish holiday on Monday.

They won't find out till Tuesday.

Beautiful.

What about the security?

No. Security? You're lookin' at it.

It's a joke. I'm the
midnight-to-8:00 man.

I'm the commandant.

He just comes in

like he's picking up
lost baggage with Tommy D.

It's beautiful.

Yeah, I don't think
it'll be a problem at all.

Ah, good. We're on.

What-- What's really funny is

the ( … )in' bank job away in Secaucus.

I'm in the middle of the
( … )in' weeds, layin' down.

He comes over, he says,
"What are you doin'?"
I said, "I'm restin'."

"Here you're restin'?

Go to a ( … )in' beach or the park."

I said, "I'm restin'. I know
I'm restin'. I'm restin'!"

They pull me in. They start giving me

all kinds of questions,
you know, this and that.

He says, "So what are you
gonna tell us, tough guy?"

I said, "My usual-- zero. Nothing.

Why tell you, ya ( … )?"

He says, "No, you're gonna tell me
something today, tough guy."

I said, "All right,
I'll tell you somethin'.

Go ( … ) your mother."
(LAUGHTER)

Bing, pow, boom, bing!

You saw the paper, Anthony.
My hair was up like this.

So now I'm comin' around, you know.

I start to come out of it.

Who do I see in front of me?
This big prick again.

He says, "Oh, what do you want
to tell me now, tough guy?"

I said, "Bing, what are you doing here?

I thought I told you
to go ( … ) your mother."

I thought he was gonna ( … ).

Pow, ping, pooh!

The mother( … )ers.

I wish I was big just once.

-The big cops.
-You're a pisser.

Really funny. Really funny.

What do you mean I'm funny?

It's funny, you know.

You're-- It's a good story.
It's funny. You're a funny guy.

What do you mean?
You mean the way I talk? What?

Just, you know, you're...
It's-- You're just funny.

It's...funny.

You know, the way you
tell the story and everything.

Funny how?
I mean, what's funny about it?

-Tommy, no, you got it all wrong.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, Anthony.

He's a big boy. He knows
what he said. What'd you say?

Funny how?

-What?
-Just...you know.

You're funny. (CHUCKLES) That's all.

You mean-- Wait, let me understand this,

'cause, you know, maybe it's me.
I'm a little ( … )ed up, maybe.

But I'm funny how?
I mean, funny like I'm a clown?

I amuse you? I make you laugh?

I'm here to ( … )in' amuse you?

What do you mean, funny?
Funny how? How am I funny?

I don't know. Just...you know.

How you tell the story. What--

No, no, I don't know. You said it.

How do I know? You said I'm funny.

How the ( … ) am I funny?

What the ( … ) is so funny about me?

Tell me. Tell me what's funny.

Get the ( … ) out of here, Tommy.

You mother( … )er! I almost had him!

I almost had him!

You stutterin' prick, you!

Frankie, was he shaking?

I wonder about you sometimes, Henry.

You may fold under questioning.

(LAUGHTER)

HENRY: Jesus Christ.

What the ( … ) is it with you?

I thought I was
gettin' pinched over here!

He's hangin' on my ( … )in'
neck like a vulture,

like impending da-- What do you want?

This guy's worried.

He didn't want to come over
and give the check.

-The waiter?
-If you could take care of this...

Yeah, it's no problem.
Tell him to put it on my tab. Of course.

That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.
It ain't just this here.

It's 7 ( … )in' big ones here,
7 ( … )in' G's you owe me.

Seven thousand dollars.
I mean, that ain't peanuts.

I don't mean to be
out of order or nothin'--

You don't mean to be out of order?

Jeez, it's good you don't
mean to be out of order, Sonny.

You come over and embarrass me
in front of my friends,

like you're callin' me
a ( … )in' deadbeat.

You know, Sonny,
you're a real ( … )in' mutt.

You know the money we spend
in this ( … )ing--

Come on, don't be like that, Tommy.

What do you mean, don't be like that?

SONNY: Jesus Christ!

Do you believe this prick?

You think this is funny, huh?
He's having...

What the ( … ) are you lookin' at?

You ( … )in'... You ( … )in' moron.

You don't wanna bring
the check, you ( … )ing--

Tommy.

Do you believe this prick?

( … )in' guy.

You're supposed to be
doing this stuff too, you know.

You're a funny guy.

-That's it, Henry! That's it, Henry!
-No, no, no, come on, come on!

Hey, you wanna laugh,
this prick last week

asked me to christen his kid.

Yeah, all right, for 7,000 I charged him!

(HENRY LAUGHING)

You really are a funny guy!

That's it! That's it!

But I'm worried. I mean,

I'm hearing all kinds
of ( … )in' bad things.

I mean, he's treatin' me
like I'm a ( … )in' half
a ( … ) or something.

I'm gonna wind up a lamist.

I gotta go on the ( … )in' lam
to get away from this guy?

This ain't right, Paulie.

I mean, I can't go here, I can't go there--

You think you're the only one?

I talk to them a million times.
They don't listen.

If you tell him, he'll stop.
I mean, what-- I'm gonna wind up
being declared an MIA.

They're gonna find me
in the back of a car,
somewhere in the weeds? Come on.

You know this ( … )in'
Tommy all your life.

This ( … )sucker's an arch criminal.

When I leave my house in the morning,

before I get to the car,
I'm lookin' over both shoulders.

This is no way to live.

You know I'm no fence-jumper.

I'm around you all my life.
You tell me what I gotta do.

Whatever the ( … )
I gotta do, I'm gonna do, no?

What could I do? If there
was somethin' I could do,

don't you think I would do it?

You know me. I would like
to help you out.

Sonny, tell him what we talked about.

-SONNY: You think it's all right?
-Yeah. Go on.

What?

Paulie, you know, look,
maybe you could come in with me,

you know, take a piece
of this ( … )in' joint. That'd be good.

What are you talkin' about?

What do you mean? The restaurant?

Yeah. I mean, this is a classy place.

I mean, look at the layout.
You've been in there a million times.

You know what it looks like. I mean...

Tommy taking over this ( … )in' joint
is like putting a silk hat on a pig.

I mean, I don't mean
no disrespect or nothin', Henry,

but that's the way it is.
I know you're his friend.

I'm begging you. What can I say?

I-- What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

What does he want from me?

I don't know what-- I don't know nothing

about the restaurant business.

Nothing. All I know is how
to sit down and order.

I don't know how to make a restaurant.

No, uh, not for you.
Just a place to hang.
You know? The chef is great.

You got a-- The ( … )in' shows are good.

There's a lot of ( … )s comin' in here.

I'd like to help you out.
Look, what do you want from me?

Tommy's a bad kid. He's a bad seed.

What am I supposed to do, shoot him?

It wouldn't be a bad idea.

I'm sorry I said that.
I didn't mean to say that.

I-- I just mean that he's scaring me.

You know, uh...

I just-- I need help, all right?
Help me, please.

You know anything about this
( … )in' restaurant business?

SONNY: He knows everything about it.
He's in the joint 24 hours a day.

I mean, another ( … )in' few--

few minutes, he could be a stool.

That's how often he's in here.
You understand me?

You want me to be your partner?

That's what you're trying to tell me?

Yeah. What the ( … ) you think
I'm talking about, Paulie?

Please. Come on.

This is not even fair, no?

-You don't understand. The joint is--
-Oh, you run the joint.

Uh, maybe I'll try
to help you. All right.

God bless you, Paulie. I appreciate it.

God bless you. You've always
been fair with me.

HENRY: Now the guy's got Paulie as a partner.

Any problems-- he goes to Paulie.

Trouble with a bill--
he can go to Paulie.

Trouble with the cops,
deliveries, Tommy-- he can call Paulie.

But now the guy's got to come up
with Paulie's money every week,

no matter what.

Business bad? ( … ) you. Pay me.

Oh, you had a fire? ( … ) you. Pay me.

Place got hit by lightning, huh?

( … ) you. Pay me.

Mind if I get one of those TVs?

No, I'll be certain you don't break any.

Also, Paulie could do anything,

especially run up bills
on the joint's credit.

And why not? Nobody's
gonna pay for it anyway.

And as soon as the deliveries
are made in the front door,

you move the stuff out the back

you bust the joint out--

She's from the Five Towns.

What? Who?

Who? The Jew broad, Diane.

I was telling you about her inside.

I've been tryin' to bang
this broad for a ( … )in' month now.

The only thing is she won't
go out with me alone, you know?

No.

-No what?
-No.

No what, Henry?
Who the ( … ) asked you anything?

I didn't even ask you anything.

-At least wait to hear
what I'm gonna say.
-All right. What?

Okay. What:

She don't want to go out
with Italians alone.

She's prejudiced against Italians.

( … )in' believe that?

In this day and age?

What the ( … ) is this world comin' to?

I can't believe this.
Prejudiced against--

A Jew broad prejudiced against Italians.

Anyway, she won't go out with me alone

unless her girlfriend comes with her.

So I figure you come along
and go out with her girlfriend.

See? I knew it.
I knew it. I knew it. I knew it.

You knew what? See what?

What the ( … ) is wrong with that?

-When is this?
-Tomorrow night.

I can't tomorrow night.
I gotta meet Tuddy.

You could meet Tuddy.
you could ( … )in' come early

and then still go.

Tommy, Tommy, why do you always do this?

Don't give me that ( … )in'

I'm asking you for a favor.

I do a lot of ( … )ing favors

I'm tryin' to bang this ( … )in' broad.

You wanna help me out?

(STAMMERING)

-HENRY: What?
-I don't understand you!

Her ( … )in' family,
they live in the Five Towns.

These Jew broads got a lotta money.

-(TIRES SCREECHING)

I had a meeting with Tuddy
around 11 o'clock,

and here I am, a backup guy for Tommy.

TOMMY: How about you, honey?
You have enough to eat?

-Yeah, it's delicious.
-Yeah?

Just watching my diet.

Let me watch your figure for you.

I couldn't wait to get away.

I was ordering the dessert
when they were eating dinner.

When they were having coffee,
I was asking for a check.

I had business.

Have some coffee. It'll wake you up.

Joe, can we have the check?

TOMMY: Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

HENRY: I gotta go.

Go where, Henry? We just got here.

I got that thing. I gotta go.

(WHISPERS) Oh, I forgot.

Wait a couple of minutes.
We'll all leave together.

This way you don't go out

like a bunch of hobos,
staggering out one at a time, you know?

WOMAN: I couldn't stand him.

I thought he was really obnoxious.

He kept fidgeting around.

You don't mind, do you?

That's very annoying.

TOMMY: It's, uh, anisette.

Good, huh?

Yeah, you'd probably do
a lot better with Manischewitz,

but it'd look funny on my table.

-Ready?
-Henry, lighten up.

We-- We just got here.
What are you doin'?

WOMAN: Before it was even
time to go home,

he was pushing me into the car
and then pulling me out.

It was ridiculous.

But Diane and Tommy made us promise

to meet them again on Friday night.

We agreed.

Of course, when Friday night
came around,

Henry stood me up.

I feel terrible.
I don't know where he is.

You know, he really liked you too.

All he did was talk about her, you know?

We were a trio instead of
a double date that night.

He should've called.
I hope it's nothing serious.

That's what I'm worried about.

But I made Tommy
take me looking for him.

(TIRES SCREECHING)

-MAN: Son of a ( … ).
-Tommy, what the ( … )?

You got some nerve, standing me up.

Nobody does that to me.

Who the hell do you think you are?

Frankie Valli or some kind of big shot?

HENRY: Take it easy.

(LAUGHTER)

Slow down. Slow down, all right? I forgot.

I thought it was next week.

It was Friday. It was this Friday,

and you agreed, so you're a liar!

Come on. We can talk about this,
all right? Take it easy.

Talk about it?

Talk to you after what
you just did to me?

Forget it. I'm not talking
to you about anything.

Wait a second. I thought
you were gonna stand me up.

You looked bored.
You didn't say anything.

What do you expect? Hmm?

Let me make it up to you. Karen.

I'll think about it.

HENRY: I remember,
she's screaming on the street,

and I mean loud.

But she looked good.

I'll think about it.

-It's gonna cost you, Hill.
-I'm gonna make it up to you.

It'll cost you a lot.

She had these great eyes,
just like Liz Taylor's.

At least that's what I thought.

(SPEAKING ITALIAN)

KAREN: It was like he had two families.

The first time I was introduced
to all of them at once,

it was crazy.

Paulie and his brothers
had lots of sons and nephews.

Paulie, I want you to meet Karen.

And almost all of them
were named Peter or Paul.

This is Peter. This is
my brother's second cousin.

It was unbelievable.

I want you to meet
Paulie Jr., my nephew.

And this is Petey.

There must have been two dozen
Peters and Pauls at the wedding.

This is Marie.

Yeah, right.

And they named all
their daughters Marie.

She drops dead right on the spot.

WOMAN 2: Well, maybe she's depressed.

Depressed? Give me a break. She's drunk.

Aw, come on. As soon--
As soon as something happens,

KAREN: They had bad skin
and wore too much makeup.

I mean, they didn't look very good.

They looked beat up.

And the stuff they wore
was thrown together and cheap--

a lot of pantsuits and double-knits.

WOMAN: She doesn't wake up
in the morning.

She spends her life in a nightgown.

That woman is no angel, believe me.

And they talked about
how rotten their kids were

and about beating them with
broom handles and leather belts,

but that the kids still
didn't pay any attention.

Look, let me tell you something.

Nobody goes to jail unless they want to,

unless they make themselves get caught.

They don't have things organized.

I know what I'm doing. I've got
things organized with these guys.

You know who goes to jail?

Because they fall asleep

None of it seemed like crimes.

It was more like Henry was enterprising

and that he and the guys
were making a few bucks hustling

while the other guys
were sitting on their asses

waiting for handouts.

Our husbands weren't brain surgeons.

They were blue-collar guys.

They only way
they could make extra money--

real extra money-- was to go out
and cut a few corners.

Yee-haw! Ha-ha!

No coffee, no. Thanks anyway.

All right. Just be careful.

All right. We're just gonna go

And I'll take the kitchen.

There was always a little harassment.

They always wanted

to talk to Henry about this or that.

They'd come in with
their subpoenas and warrants

and make me sign.

But mostly they were just
looking for a handout,

a few bucks to keep things quiet

no matter what they found.

(WHISTLING)

I always asked them
if they wanted coffee.

Some of the wives, like Mickey Conway,

used to curse at them
and spit on the floor.

She used to spit on her own floor.

That never made any sense to me.

It was better to be polite
and call the lawyer.

Top of the morning to you.

BATTS: Good to be home.

HENRY: Welcome back.

This is my friend Jimmy.

Henry. It's his joint.

This is Lisa.

-Hey, Frankie, how are ya?
-Hey, Tommy. All dressed up.

All grown up and doing
the town. Look at this.

-Oh, ( … ).
-Tommy!

I forgot he was having
a party here for this mouth.

Oh! Oh! Come here!

Jesus Christ. Let me go say hello.

-Hey, Billy, how are you?
-Tommy, get over here.

I haven't seen you
in six ( … )ing years.

-How you doing, Billy? Oh, whoa.
-Jesus Christ Almighty.

You look terrific.

-How you feeling?
-Watch the suit! Watch the suit.

"Watch the suit." You little prick, you.

-Hey, I know you all my life.
-All right. Good.

Don't go gettin' too big on me now.

Just don't go busting

Hey, Tommy, if I was
gonna break your ( … ),

I'd tell you to go home
and get your shine box.

(LAUGHTER)

Oh, this kid was--
This kid was great. They--

They used to call him
"Spitshine Tommy." I swear to God.

Oh, he'd make your shoes
look like ( … )in' mirrors.

Excuse my language.

He was terrific. He was the best.

And he made a lot of money too.

Salute, Tommy.

No more shines, Billy.

-What?
-I said no more shines.

Maybe you didn't hear about it.
You've been away a long time.

I don't shine shoes anymore.

Relax, will you? For crying out--

What's got into you? I'm breaking
your ( … ) a little bit, that's all.

I'm only kiddin' with ya.

Sometimes you don't sound
like you're kidding.

You know, there's a lotta people around.

Tommy, I'm only kidding
with you. We're having a party.

I just came home, I haven't
seen you in a long time,
and I'm breakin' your ( … ),

and right away,
you're gettin' ( … )in' fresh.

I'm sorry. I don't mean to offend you.

I'm sorry too. It's okay. No problem.

Okay. Salute.

Now go home and get your
( … )in' shine box.

(BREAKS GLASS) Mother( … )in' mutt!

You-- You ( … )in' piece of ( … )!

Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on. Come on! Come on!

-Let him go.
-Henry, he bought his ( … )in' button,

-You bought your ( … )in' button!
-Take it easy. Take it easy.

Don't get nervous. Don't
get nervous. Let him come.

( … )-- Keep that mother( … )er here.

Keep him here. Keep him here.

-Batts. Batts.
-Come on! You ( … )in' feel strong?

I'm sorry. Tommy gets a little loaded.

He doesn't mean any disrespect.

He don't mean any disrespect, Henry?

Teach this kid
a little ( … )in' manners!

Hey, Jimmy, what's right is right.

You understand what I'm talkin' about?

It's all right. It's all right.

No, I mean, the kid's over here,

we're huggin' and kissin' over here,

and two minutes later,
he's actin' like a ( … )in' jerk.

No, no, no, no, no.
You insulted him a little bit.

You got a little out of order yourself.

-No, I didn't insult him.
-You insulted him a little bit.

No, I didn't insult nobody.
Give us a drink. Give us a drink.

Okay.

Come on, let's have some drinks.
Drinks on the house. Let me--

-Yeah. No, have the drink with me.
-No, no, no, no, no.

Billy, Billy, drinks are on the house.

-Go on. On the house.
-I'll ( … ) him in his ( … ).

Don't worry. I know a place
upstate they'll never find him.

Come on, let's get
some more tablecloths.

I didn't want to get
blood on your floor.

Henry, go open your trunk.

You got it? Got it?

Yeah.

TOMMY: I'll pick up a shovel
at my mother's house.

She keeps a shovel
right around here somewhere.

Just keep quiet 'cause I don't wanna
wake her up, you know.

Oh.

Look who's here. Look who's here.

TOMMY: Hey, Ma, what's going on?

What are you doing? What happened?

-No, no, no, nothing.
-What happened to you?

I hit somethin' on the road.
Jimmy'll tell you.

-What happened, Jimmy?
-Nothing, nothing, nothing.

How are you? How are you?

I haven't seen you in so long. What happened?

I hate to see him that way.

-Hi. How are you?
-You too. How are you? What happened?

What are you doing up so late?

Well, he came in. Youse came in.
I figured, you know--

-It's 3:00 in the morning.
-I'm so happy to see him.

Look, go inside.
Make yourselves comfortable.

-No. No, no, no. Go to sleep.
-I'll make you something to eat.

-We're gonna leave.
-No, I can't sleep.

Not while he's home.
I haven't seen him in so long.

I wanna see him. Look, youse go inside.

This stuff is great, but it's like lead.

So, tell me. Tell me. Where you been?

I haven't seen you. I haven't even--

You haven't even called or anything.

Where have you been?

Ma, I've been working nights.

And?

And, well, tonight we were out late.

We took a ride on the...

out to the country,
and we hit one of those deers.

That's where all the blood came from.
I told you.

Jimmy told you before.

Anyway, you know, that reminds me, Ma,
I need this knife.

I'm gonna take this. It's okay?

Okay, yeah. Bring it back,
though, you know.

Well, the poor thing, you know, he got--

I hit him in his, uh--

We hit the deer in his paw.
What do you call it?

-The paw. The paw. His foot.
-TOMMY: The paw.

The hoof.

The hoof got caught in the grill,

and I gotta-- I gotta hack it off.

-Ooh!
-Hey, Ma, it's a sin.

You gonna leave it there?
You know, so...

Anyway, I'll-- I'll bring
your knife back after I do that.

-Delicious. Delicious.
-Thank you.

Why don't you get yourself a nice girl?

I get a nice one almost every night, Ma.

Yeah, but get yourself a girl
so you can settle down.

I settle down almost every night,

but then in the morning,
I'm free. I love you.

I wanna be with you.

Why don't you settle down?

How's your friend Henry there?

Henry, what's the matter?
You don't talk too much.

JIMMY: You should talk a little bit.
What are you gettin' quiet for?

You don't eat much. You don't talk much.

Uh, I'm just listening.

-TOMMY: Is something wrong with you?
-No.

MOTHER: You remind me
of when we were kids,

the compares used to visit one another,

and there was this man.

He would never talk.
He would just sit there all night

and not say a word.

So they says to him,
"What's the matter, compare?

Don't you talk? Don't you say anything?"

He says, "What am I gonna say?

That my wife two-times me?"

So she says to him,

"Shut up! You're always talking."

(LAUGHTER)

But in Italian, it sounds much nicer.

(SPEAKS ITALIAN) Yeah.

That's it.

JIMMY: What's that mean?

It means he's-- He's content to be a jerk.

Ah.

And he doesn't care
who knows it. He's...

Did Tommy ever tell you
about my painting?

No.

Look at this.

Ah. It's beautiful.

TOMMY: I like this one.
One dog goes one way,

and the other dog goes the other way.

One is going east, and the other one
is going west. So what?

TOMMY: And this guy's saying,
"What do you want from me?"

Guy's got a nice head of white hair.

Look how beautiful with the dog.
It looks the same.

Looks like somebody we know.

(JIMMY AND TOMMY LAUGHING)

Without the beard. No, it's him.

Oh! (LAUGHING)

It's him! Oh!

Oh, Marone!

(THUMP)

(THUMP)

What the ( … ) is that?

HENRY: For most of the guys,
killings got to be accepted.

Murder was the only way
that everybody stayed in line.

You got out of line, you got whacked.

Everybody knew the rules.

But sometimes even if people
didn't get out of line,

they got whacked.

I mean, hits just became
a habit for some of the guys.

Guys would get into arguments
over nothing,

and before you knew it,
one of them was dead.

And they were shooting
each other all the time.

Shooting people was a normal thing.

It was no big deal.

We had a...

We had a serious problem
with Billy Batts.

This was really a touchy thing.

Tommy had killed a made guy.

Batts was part of the Gambino crew

and was considered untouchable.

Before you could touch a made guy,

you had to have a good reason.

You had to have a sit-down,
and you better get an okay,

or you'd be the one who got whacked.

(FIRE SIZZLING)

MAN: Hey, Frankie, how are you?

How you doing?

Good to see you. Vito.

Hey. How are ya, buddy?

Saturday night was for wives,

but Friday night at the Copa
was always for the girlfriends.

(FRANKIE SPEAKING ITALIAN)

And last week we saw Sammy Davis Jr.

You got to see this show.
What a performer.

He does these impersonations.

I swear, you would think
it was the real people.

Oh, it's unbelievable.

I mean, you could see how
a white girl can fall for him.

What?

Well, I mean, not me.
I'm just saying, like,

you could see how
some girls could, you know,

like that Swedish girl.

In other words, you condone that stuff?

Take it easy. Ha-ha-ha!

-Henry--
-I know. I know. I know.

I don't wanna wind up kissing
( … )in' Nat King Cole over here.

No, I'm not talkin' about me.
I'm just sayin'-- No, I'm not--

You know, you can see how a girl could.

He's got personality.

-Oh, of course. Yeah.
-Personality?

(SPEAKS ITALIAN) A guy with personality.

He's very talented.

I understand perfectly
what you're saying,

but you have to watch out
sometimes how you say things.

You know, people get
the wrong impression.

I just said he was talented.
You know, he's unbelievable.

Why don't you just leave it alone now?

I understand what you said.
You know, the guy's talented.

Leave it at that. He's very talented.

to the house every day, commiserating.

The two of them. I can't have it.

I can't have it.

You know? I just-- I can't do it, Henry.
You know? I-I-It's...

-Can't do it.
-Nobody says

that you can't do what you wanna do.

Do what you wanna do.
We all know that. I mean...

This is what it is, okay?
We know what it is.

You have to do the right thing.

You have to go home
to the family, you understand?

You gotta go home, okay?

Look at me. You gotta go home.

Smarten up.

-All right?
-Yeah.

All right. I'm gonna talk to Karen.

I'll straighten this thing out.

I know just what to say to her.

Okay? I'm gonna tell her
you're gonna go back to her,

and everything's gonna be
just the way it was when
you were first married.

There's gonna be romance.
It's gonna be beautiful.

-(SCOFFS)
-I know how to talk
to her, especially to her.

In the meantime, Jimmy and Tommy

were going down to Tampa
this weekend to pick up
something for me.

Instead, you go with Jimmy.

Yeah, you come with me.
We'll go down there, okay?

PAULIE: Have a good time.
Take some time for yourself.

Relax. Sit in the sun.

-Take a couple of days off.
-How about that?

Enjoy yourselves.
And when you come back,

you'll go back to Karen.

-Huh?
-HENRY: Okay.

Please. There's no other way.

You're not gonna get a divorce.

-We're not animale.
-Not gonna get a divorce.

She'll never divorce him.

She'll kill him,
but she won't divorce him.

-(CHUCKLING)
-PAULIE: Yeah. Yeah.

(GRUNTING)

You gonna pay it? Huh?

I ain't got it. I swear.

Huh? You gonna pay?

Just give us the ( … )in' money, huh?!

I can't.

I-- I can't. I swear.

Let's go. Let's go.

Come on, we'll throw
the bastard to the lions.

No. No!

What ( … )in' lions? I ain't going near
any lions, Jimmy!

Just throw him over the moat.

No! I'll get it!

I'll get the money!

HENRY: They must really feed each other
to the lions down there,

because the guy gave the money right up.

I swear to Christ I'll get the money.

And we got to spend the rest
of the weekend at the track.

Yeah. They mean business.

Then I couldn't believe what happened.

When we got home,
we were all over the newspaper.

At first, I didn't even know
why we got picked up.

Then I found out
that the guy we roughed up

turned out to have a sister
working as a typist for the FBI.

Who could believe it?
Of all the ( … )ing people!

She gave up everybody--
Jimmy, me, even her brother.

TYPIST (CRYING): He's friends of him.

HENRY: Took the jury six hours
to bring us in guilty.

Judge gave Jimmy and me 10 years
like he was giving away candy.

...10 years in a federal penitentiary.

You will now be turned over

to the United States
Attorney General's office.

(GAVEL BANGS)

MORRIE: Well, sweet Henry. Toast, guys.

Good trip, good life. Get out soon.

Good trip, sweetheart.

Salute, Henry

All the best.

We'll watch the home front while you're gone.

(SPEAKS ITALIAN)

Say hello to those ( … )-job hacks, huh?

Don't forget-- mother( … ) them
every chance you get, huh?

(LAUGHTER)

HENRY: I'll call you, uh,
when I get a chance.

(CAR DOOR OPENS)

(CLOSES)

Now take me to jail.

In prison, dinner was
always a big thing.

We had a pasta course,

and then we had a meat or a fish.

Paulie did the prep work.

He was doing a year for contempt,

and he had this wonderful system
for doing the garlic.

He used a razor,
and he used to slice it so thin

that it used to liquefy in a pan
with just a little oil.

It was a very good system.

Vinnie was in charge
of the tomato sauce.

Ah! Get that smell?

Got three, uh, kinds of meat
in the meatballs.

You got veal, beef, and pork.

MAN: Ah, good.
But you gotta have the pork.

Oh, that's-- That's-- That's the flavor.

I-- I felt he used too many onions,

but it was still a very good sauce.

Vinnie, don't put too many
onions in the sauce.

VINNIE: I didn't put
too much onions in, Paul.

Three small onions. That's all I did.

MAN: Three onions? How many cans
of tomatoes you put in there?

VINNIE: I put two cans.

-Two big cans.
-MAN: You don't need three onions.

Johnny Dio did the meat.
We didn't have a broiler,

so Johnny did everything in pans.

It used to smell up
the joint something awful,

and the hacks used to die,

but he still cooked a great steak.

Vinnie, how do you like yours?

Rare. Medium rare.

Medium rare? Hmm, an aristocrat.

See, you know,
when you think of prison...

Vinnie, here's your lobsters.

...you get pictures in your mind
of all those old movies

with rows and rows of guys behind bars.

But it wasn't like that for wiseguys.

It really wasn't that bad,
excepting that I missed Jimmy.

He was doing his time in Atlanta.

DIO: Vinnie, give me
two steaks while you're
in there, all right?

I mean, everybody else in
the joint was doing real time,

all mixed together, living like pigs.

But we lived alone.

I mean, we owned the joint.

DIO: ...baseball-batted
them two son of a ( … )es

till you couldn't recognize 'em.

Good. They deserved it.

Even the hacks we couldn't bribe

would never rat on the guys that we did.

VINNIE: People in
the neighborhood had respect.

People loved one another.
You left your doors open.

Sorry it took so long.

That skinny guard's getting
to be a real pain in the ( … ).

We're gonna have to do
something about that bastard.

I took care of him.

All right, what'd you bring?

All right, uh...bread.

Good. Fresh.

HENRY: Vinnie, I got
your peppers and onions.

Salami, prosciutto, a lot of cheese.

Come on, come on. What else?

-Scotch.
-PAULIE: Nice.

Here's some red wine.

Okay. Now we can eat.

-Wait, I got some white too.
-Give me the white too.

Beautiful.

Okay, boys, let's eat.

Come on. It's ready, Vinnie.

Here's some more bread.

Tomorrow we eat sandwiches.
You gotta go on a diet, Vinnie.

-You ain't kidding.
-Believe me.

Johnny?

PAULIE: Read 'em and weep.

(PAULIE LAUGHING)

What are you doing?

Yeah, I'll take that.

Tryin' to lose?

All right, I'll catch you guys later.

Here. You going for a walk in the park?

Okay. I'll catch you next week.

-Thanks, Henry.
-Thanks. All right.

Are there any more?

Nope, that's it.

-Have a good weekend. Thanks.
-Thank you, Henry.

(DOOR BUZZER SOUNDING)

Ms. Hill, come here.

Come on.

You girls stay right here.

-I want you to hold hands.
-Go up to the front of the door.

Together. Let's go.

-How you doing?
-Good. How are you?

Very well, thank you.

What are you talkin' about?

I saw her name in the register.

-Jesus Christ.
-You want her to visit you?

Let her stay up all night crying

and writing letters to the parole board.

What am I doin' here?
Where am I? I'm in jail.

I can't stop people
from comin' to see me.

Good. Let her sneak this stuff
in for you every week.

Let her fight with
these bastards every week!

-(CRYING)
-Look what you're doing! Stop it!

-Shh.
-I'm sorry.

Let her sneak this ( … )
in for you, Henry.

Let her sneak this ( … ) in for you.

Stop it, Karen! Will you stop it?

Let her do it.

-Let her do it!
-Stop it!

(RUTH CRYING)

Shh. Shh. Shh.

Ruth. Ruth, Ruth, come here.

-Shh.
-Nobody's helping me.

I'm all alone.

Belle and Morrie are broke.

I asked your friend Remo
for the money that he owes you.

You know what he told me?

He told me to take my kids
down to the police station

and get on welfare.

Karen, it's gonna be okay.

Even Paulie, since he got out,

I never see him.
I never see anybody anymore.

It's only you and me.

That's what happens when you go away.

I've told you that. We're on our own.

Forget everybody else. Forget Paulie.

Okay? As long as he's on parole,

he doesn't want anybody doing anything.

Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

I can't do it.

Yes, you can, Karen. Listen to me.

All I need for you is
to keep bringing me this stuff.

I got a guy in here from Pittsburgh

who's gonna help me move it.

Believe me, in a month,
we're gonna be fine.

We won't need anybody.

I'm afraid.

I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.

What'd I just say?
Don't worry about him.

He is not helping us out.

Is he putting any food on the table?

We've gotta help each other.
We just gotta--

Listen, we gotta be really,
really careful while we do it.

I don't wanna hear a word
about her anymore, Henry.

Never.

GIRLS: Daddy!

-JUDY: Oh, we missed you.
-RUTH: Are you here to stay?

JUDY: Did you see our pictures?

I did the one with the house
and the rainbow.

RUTH: I did the sun.

My chorus concert is in two weeks.

Are you coming?

You like the house?

Karen, get packed.
We're moving out of here.

With what?

Don't worry with what.

You just start looking
for a new house, okay?

I gotta go to Pittsburgh in the morning.

Those guys out there,
they owe me 15 grand.

We'll be all right.
I got things lined up.

Pittsburgh? You have to go see
your parole officer tomorrow.

Karen, don't worry about it.

Everything's gonna be fine.

Who wants to go to Uncle Paulie's?

BOTH: Me!

-HENRY: You hungry?
-Yeah!

PAULIE: You know, he's an arrogant guy.

He didn't do the right thing.

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

What? What do you want?

WOMAN: Sweetheart, let Mommy eat, huh?

You look good. You eat good.

Did we eat this good in the joint?

I don't want any more of that ( … ).

What ( … )? What are you talking about?

Just stay away from the garbage.
You know what I mean.

What? Paulie--

I'm not talking about what you did inside.
You did what you had to do.

I'm talking about now.
From now, here and now.

Paulie, why would I want
to get into that? I'm not--

Don't make a jerk out of me.
Just don't do it.

Just don't do it.

Now, I wanna talk to you about Jimmy.

You gotta watch out for him.

He's a good earner, but he's wild,

takes too many chances.
-No, I know that. I know Jimmy.

You think I would
take chances like Jimmy?

And Tommy, he's a good kid too.

But he's crazy. He's a cowboy.
He's got too much to prove.

You gotta watch out for kids like this.

Yeah, I know what they are.
I only use them for certain things.
Believe me, you don't have to--

Listen, I ain't gonna get ( … )ed
like Gribbs, you understand?

Gribbs is 70 years old,

and the ( … )in' guy's gonna die in prison.

I don't need that.

So I'm warnin' everybody.

Everybody-- could be my son,
could be anybody.

Gribbs got 20 years
just for saying hello

to some ( … ) who was sneaking
behind his back sellin' junk.

I don't need that.

Ain't gonna happen to me. You understand?

Uh-huh.

You know that you're only out
early 'cause I got you a job,

and I don't need this heat.

And you see anybody ( … )in'
around with this ( … ),

you're gonna tell me, right?
-Yeah.

That means anybody.

-All right. Yeah.
-Yeah?

Yeah, of course.

It took me about a week
of sneaking around

before I could unload
the Pittsburgh stuff,

but when I did, it was a real score.

I-- I started using
Sandy's place to mix the stuff,

and even with Sandy
snorting more than she mixed,

I could see that this
was a really good business.

I made $12,000 on my second week.

I had a down payment on my house,

and things were really rolling.

All I had to do
was every once in a while

was tell Sandy that I loved her.

♪ Mmm, a flood is threatening ♪

But it was perfect.

I'm telling you,
as long as I kept getting

this stuff from Pittsburgh,

I knew Paulie would never find out.

Within a couple of weeks,
it got to be so big,

I needed some help.

So I got Jimmy and Tommy
to come in with me.

Nice.

It's ( … )ing great. What nice?

Mr. Conway.

How are you? How ya doin'?

Go ahead, sit in it, Belle.

Okay, you ready?

Watch the wall with the rock.

BELLE: Karen, that is so...

KAREN: The electricians
did it special. Come on.

Come on.

-All right.
-This was imported.

It came in two pieces.

Can you believe what they can do?

-See? It's nice, huh?
-Henry, come over here.

-Did you and Jimmy talk?
-Yeah. I talked to him,

and he's looking into everything.

This'll make the Air France haul
look like goddamn peanuts.

Shh. Morrie, come on.

But it's okay? He's gonna do it, right?

I just told you.
He's gonna check everything out.

He's looking into it,
and we'll see what happens.

-No promises.
-Yeah, I know. I know. I know.

Do ya understand?

There's millions in there.

And I've been bleeding for this caper.

I've been cultivating
this son of a ( … ) for two years.

He owes me 20 grand.

Once in a lifetime. I could retire.

No more nut every week.
No more bull( … ).

Oh, my dream comes true.

Morrie, let's get a drink.

And these were the guys
that Jimmy put together

for what turned out
to be the biggest heist

in American history--
the Lufthansa heist.

Tommy and Carbone were
gonna grab the outside guard

and make him get us in the front door.

Frenchy and Joe Buddha
had to round up the workers.

Johnny Roastbeef had
to keep them all tied up

and away from the alarms.

This is a lock.

Even Stacks Edwards got in on it.

He used to hang around
the lounge and play guitar.

Everybody loved Stacks.

What he was supposed to do
was steal the panel truck

and afterwards compact it by
a friend of ours out in Jersey.

Only Morrie was driving us nuts.

Morrie, have a drink and shut up.

Just because he set this up,

he felt he could bust Jimmy's ( … )

for an advance on the money
we were gonna steal.

He didn't mean anything by it.
That-- That's just...

That's just the way he was.

Just watch the game.

♪ I'm a flea-bit peanut monkey ♪

I had everybody working for me,

even our old babysitter Lois Byrd.

Did you have a good flight?

I hate Pittsburgh.
Where do you find such creeps?

Oh, come on. They're not that bad.

And it's worth it, isn't it?

Is this the same baby
you used last week?

No. That one was my sister's.

-Jimmy, can I talk to you a second, hey?
-Morrie, Morrie, Morrie, don't.

I mastermind the goddamn thing,
I'm left with zip?

They'd be up a creek
without a paddle if not for me.

Henry, I want my ( … )in' money!
I had it up to here!

-All right.
-That cheap, cigarette-hijackin' Mick!

-Morrie! Shh.
-No, ( … ) him! I want my money!

Good. Go tell him.

Now are you gonna keep
your mouth shut or what?

Huh?

Morrie, you're gonna get your money.

You just gotta stop bustin' ( … ).

All right? Look at me. You hear me?

Look-- Look at me, okay?

Everything's gonna be fine.

Henry.

I could see for the first time
that Jimmy was a nervous wreck.

His mind was going

in eight different directions at once.

You think Morrie tells
his wife everything?

Morrie? Him?

That's when I knew Jimmy
was gonna whack Morrie.

That's how it happens.

That's how fast it takes
for a guy to get whacked.

You know him. He's a nutjob.
He talks to everybody.

You see his commercials,
acting like a jerk.

Nobody listens to what he says.

Nobody ( … )ing cares what he says,

he talks so much.

Make sure you bring him here tonight.

-Okay?
-All right.

Start like this. Oh, sorry.

Did I get you in the eye?

Morrie, stop breakin'
my ( … ), all right?

I was just stalling for time.

I knew I still had
till eight or nine o'clock

to talk Jimmy out of killing Morrie.

But meanwhile, as far as Jimmy knew,

I was going along with the program.

TOMMY: I pulled his hair
out of his ( … )in' head.

I bit him. I'm ( … )ing--

I'm ( … )ing-- I'm enraged.

I wanted to kill this little ( … ).

I walk away. We start
to go in the ( … )in' joint.

All of a sudden--
I don't wanna turn around--

Jimmy's going like this to me.

I don't want to ( … )in' turn around.

I don't know what's going on.

He picks up his ( … )in' head.
He says, "Aghh! Aghh! Aghh!"

I said, "Don't say it."

(LAUGHTER)

"Ahh... Ahh... Ahh... Ahh...

( … )off!"

TOMMY: What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?

I ( … )in' fly at him.

(DROWNED OUT BY LAUGHTER)

Forget about tonight.
Forget about tonight.

It was like a load off my mind.

Poor bastard.

He never knew how close
he'd come to getting killed.

Even if I told him,
he would've never believed me.

(LAUGHING BOISTEROUSLY)

MORRIE: Jimmy, could I talk to you now?

Son of a ( … ). You know you're a pisser?

-You wanna talk now?
-Please.

Okay, let's talk. Let's get it over with.

I swear to God,
I never known a ball-buster

Hey, who loves you more than I do, huh?

-I'd do anything for you!
-Yeah, except to stop busting my ( … ).

Come on, let's go have coffee.

You want to go to the diner or what?

We'll go to the diner
over there on the boulevard.

-MORRIE: Oh, good.
-JIMMY: Which diner?

On Rockaway Boulevard.
It's open 24 hours, so...

-They got Danish there?
-Yeah, they got everything.

Oh, good. Let's pick up
some Danish for Belle.

You hear about the points

-No, I didn't.
-Oh, it was terrific. Yeah.

TOMMY: What do you wanna do with him?

Get rid of him. Chop him up,

-Call me when you get through.
-All right.

All right, Frankie, let's chop him up.

All right. Let's go.

BELLE: It's Belle. Let me in, please.

Morris didn't come home.

He's missing.
I-- I know something's happened.

HENRY: Belle, calm down. What?

He's missing. I know something happened.

He's probably drunk
and fell asleep somewhere.

I'll look for him in the morning.

In 27 years he's never been away
all night without calling.

I know something's happened.
I know you know.

Belle, Belle, let me go

I'll take you home,

(TIRES SCREECHING)

(ERIC CLAPTON'S "LAYLA" PLAYING)

Jimmy was cutting every link
between himself and the robbery,

but it had nothing to do with me.

I gave Jimmy the tip,

and he gave me some Christmas money.

From then on I kept my mouth shut.

I knew Jimmy. He had the cash.

It was his.

I know he kicked
some money upstairs to Paulie,

but that was it.

It made him sick to have
to turn money over

to the guys who stole it.

He'd rather whack 'em.

Anyway, what did I care?

I wasn't asking for anything,

and besides, Jimmy was making
nice money with me

through my Pittsburgh connections.

Still, months after the robbery,

they were finding bodies all over.

(CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING)

When they found Carbone
in the meat truck,

he was frozen so stiff,
it took them two days

to thaw him out for the autopsy.

(JIMMY LAUGHING)

Still, I never saw Jimmy so happy.

He was like a kid.

We had money coming in
through my Pittsburgh people,

and even after a while,

the Lufthansa thing began to calm down.

But the thing that made Jimmy
so happy that morning

was that this was the day
that Tommy was being made.

Jimmy was so excited,
you'd think he was being made.

He must have made four calls
to Tommy's house.

They had a signal all set up

so he'd know that the minute that
the ceremony was over.

Ma. Ma, where are you?

Oh, here I am.

-You're home?
-Home? I'm leavin'.

I've been here all the while.

-Let me look at you.
-What do you think? I look good?

You look wonderful.
Listen, just be careful.

Congratulations.
I wish you lots of luck.

I love you.

Don't paint any more
religious pictures, please.

Be careful. God be with you.

Bye, Ma.

You know, we always
called each other goodfellas.

Like you'd say to somebody,
"You're gonna like this guy.

"He's all right. He's a good fella.

He's one of us."

You understand?

We were goodfellas, wiseguys.

But Jimmy and I could never be made

because we had Irish blood.

It didn't even matter
that my mother was Sicilian.

To become a member of a crew,

you've got to be 100 percent Italian

so they can trace all your relatives

back to the old country.

See, it's the highest honor
they can give you.

It means you belong
to a family and a crew.

It means that nobody
can ( … ) around with you.

It also means
you can ( … ) around with anybody

just as long as they
aren't also a member.

It's like a license to steal.
It's a license to do anything.

VINNIE: Buona fortuna, Tommy.

TOMMY: All right, thanks, Vinnie.

Hey, how many years ago
was it you was made?

Ahh, I'm an old-timer--
30 years ago.

Thirty years, huh?
Brings back a lot of memories.

And how.

Pikes Peak was a ( … )ing
pimple then, wasn't it?

(BOTH LAUGH)

As far as Jimmy was concerned,
with Tommy being made,

it was like we were all being made.

We would now have
one of our own as a member.

TOMMY: Oh, no.

(GUNSHOT)

Yeah. Who's this?

(OVER TELEPHONE): Yeah. This is Vinnie.

Vinnie, what happened?

Did everything get straightened out?

No, we had a problem. I mean, uh...

we tried to do everything we could.

-What do you mean?
-Well, you know what I mean.

He's gone, and we couldn't
do nothing about it.

That's it.

What do you mean?
What do you mean? Uh...

He's gone. He's gone.

And that's it.

Mother( … )er!

I can't ( … )in' believe--

I knew it.

I can't ( … )in' believe it.
I can't ( … )ing...

(TELEPHONE BOOTH CRASHES)

(HORN BLARING IN DISTANCE)

(CRYING)

You all right?

HENRY: It was revenge for Billy Batts...

and a lot of other things.

And that's that.

There was nothing
that we could do about it.

Batts was a made man, and Tommy wasn't.

We had to sit still and take it.

It was among the Italians.
It was real greaseball ( … ).

(SOBBING)

They even shot Tommy in the face

so his mother couldn't give him
an open coffin at the funeral.

Oh, my God.

When I finally got there at the hospital

to pick up Michael, his doctor wanted

to put me in bed.

Jesus Christ, what happened to you?

Uh, nothing. I just almost
got into an accident
right now driving over here.

I told him about the accident,

and I said I was partying all night.

-No, I'm fine, doc.
-Come on, get over here.

-Doc, I'm fine.
-Let me check you out.

Come on.

He took mercy on me.
He gave me ten milligrams

of Valium and sent me home.

Now, my plan was to drop off
my brother at the house

and pick up Karen.

Bunch of stuff I gotta do...

HENRY: There it is. See that, Michael?
See that helicopter?

-See it right there?
-Where?

-Right in front of us there.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I think it's been
following me all morning.

Get the ( … ) outta here.
What are you, nuts?

I'm telling you.

I don't know what's going on.

It's the third time I've seen it.

I went to the hospital,
I saw it out to get you.

I had to stop somewhere,
make some couple stops.

I've seen it every time.
I've been all over town,

and that thing, I've seen it all day.

See, I was cooking dinner that night.

I had to start braising
the beef, pork butt,

and veal shanks for the tomato sauce.

MICHAEL: Karen, I'm gonna make 'em all.
I'm gonna make all this meat.

It was Michael's favorite.

I was making ziti with the meat gravy,

and I'm planning to roast
some peppers over the flames,

and I was gonna put on some string beans

with some olive oil and garlic,
and I had some beautiful cutlets

that were cut just right

that I was gonna fry up before
dinner just as an appetizer.

All right, so I was home
for about an hour.

Now, my plan was
to start the dinner early

so Karen and I could unload
the guns that Jimmy didn't want

and then get the package
for Lois to take to Atlanta

for her trip later that night.

Who's been carving
their initials in the tomato?

Now, I kept looking out the window,

and I saw that the helicopter was gone.

Michael, keep an eye
on the sauce, all right?

Just stay here with your
Uncle Michael, all right?
I'll see you later.

So I asked my brother Michael
to watch the sauce,

and Karen and I started out.

Oh, God.

Oh, God, I see it.

-What?
-I see it. Look left. It's right there.

Damn!

-HENRY: Yep, that's it.
-There it is.

Come on, we gotta get--
We gotta get to your mother's.

and get the package ready
for Lois to take on her trip.

Also, I had to get to Sandy's house

to give the package
a whack with quinine.

not to let the sauce stick,
to keep stirring it.

Henry says don't let the sauce stick.

I'm stirring it.

Okay, listen, you know what to do?

-Yeah, yeah.
-Don't "Yeah, yeah" me, Lois.

This is important.

Now, make sure you leave the house when
you make the call.

You understand me? You hear me?

She picks up the phone
and calls from the house.

Now, if anybody was listening,
they'd know everything.

They'd know that a package
was leaving from my house,

and they'd even have
the time and the flight number

thanks to her.
-Hi. it's Lois.

As soon as I got home,
I started cooking.

I had a few hours until Lois's flight.

I told my brother
to keep an eye on the stove.

All day long the poor guy's
been watching helicopters

and tomato sauce.

Don't let Karen touch the sauce.

He offered to give me some money.

He just wants to know what's happening.

He just wants to talk to you.

( … ) Jimmy and his money. I told you,

I gotta get outta here
and straight out everything with Paulie,

or else I'm dead, Karen.

Then you're better off staying in here.

Karen, they can whack me in here

just as easy as they can outside,

maybe even easier.

They're all afraid
I'm gonna rat them out.

People already are walking away from me.

I'm dead in here. You gotta get me out.

Karen finally got her mother
to put her house up for my bail,

and I was out.

I remember I had this feeling
I was gonna get killed

right outside the jail.

I knew Paulie was still pissed at me,

and he's such a hothead,

and I was worried about Jimmy.

See, Jimmy knew if Paulie found out

he was in the ( … ) deals with me,

Paulie would have Jimmy whacked
even before me.

This is the bad time.

I didn't feel safe until I got home.

Karen.

So now my plan was
to stay alive long enough

to sell off the dope
that the cops never found

and then disappear for a while

until I can get things straightened out.

Karen! ( … ).

Where's the stuff that I left, Karen?

I flushed it down the toilet.

You what?

What was I supposed to do?
They were all over the house.

Karen, that was worth $60,000!

I need that money! That's all we got!

What was I supposed to do?

They had a search warrant.
They were in everything.

That's all the money that we had, Karen!

I was depending on that!
Why did you do that?

I had to. They were gonna find it!

Oh, ( … ), Karen,

Oh, no!

You know. It's like he's crazy.

Take this for now.
It's a couple thousand.

Thanks, Jimmy.

Don't worry, honey.
Everything's gonna be all right.

Listen, I got some
beautiful Dior dresses.

You want to have 'em?

Pick out a few for yourself.

Huh?

-For my mom.
-Yeah, whatever. Take a few.

No, no, no. It's over here.

It's in the store on the corner.

It's swag, so I got it down the corner.

Okay?

Go ahead, sweetheart. I'll see you.

-Thanks, Jimmy.
-Don't worry. Don't worry.

-I'll try.
-All right? Don't forget.
He's gotta call me.

All right.

Over here?

Right down there.

JIMMY: Yeah.

No, no. It's right down there.
Right on the corner.

Yeah, it's over there. Right there.

(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

JIMMY: No. No, no, no. Hey, go ahead.
It's right in there.

-No, Jimmy.
-Right there.

I'm in a hurry!

My mom's watching the kids.
I gotta get home!

I'll come back later.

(TIRES SCREECHING)

Karen? Karen?

What happened? Karen?

Nothing.

-What happened?
-I just got scared.

I just got scared.

You got the keys?

What happened, Karen?

I just got scared, Henry.
It's o-- It's okay.

-You all right?
-Yeah.

(CRYING)

Shh.

HENRY: If you're part of a crew,

nobody ever tells you
that they're going to kill you.

Doesn't happen that way.

There weren't any arguments
or curses like in the movies.

See, your murderers come with smiles.

They come as your friends,

the people who have cared
for you all of your life,

and they always seem to come at a time

when you're at your weakest
and most in need of their help.

So I met Jimmy in a crowded
place we both knew.

I got there 15 minutes early,

and I saw that Jimmy was already there.

He took the booth near the window

so he could see everyone
who drove up to the restaurant.

He wanted to make sure I wasn't tailed.

He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing.

On the surface, of course,

everything was supposed to be fine.

We were supposed
to be discussing my case.

But I had the feeling
Jimmy was trying to sense

whether I was gonna rat him out
to save my neck.

I been telling you your whole life--

don't talk on the ( … )in' phone, right?

Now you understand? Huh?

But it's gonna be okay.

I think you got a good chance
at beating the case.

Yeah, well... You know that kid?

You know, from the city
we're talking about?

You know who I'm talking...?

Yeah.

Well, the kid turned out to be a rat.

As soon as he got pinched,
he ratted everybody out.

He ratted youse all out.

But I know where he is. He's hiding out.

He's-- You know. He's...

You know what I'm saying?

Would you have a problem
going with Anthony on vacation?

I don't think you're really...

Mm-mmm.

No, not at all.

That way they got nothing, huh?

Jimmy had never asked me
to whack somebody before,

but now he's asking me
to go down to Florida

and do a hit with Anthony.

That's when I knew

I would never have come back
from Florida alive.

You know what? Um...

I think I'll have an English muffin.

And whenever you move me,

I asked you once,
and I'm gonna tell you again,

I don't wanna go anyplace that's cold.

You really don't have
a choice in that matter.

Ed, come on.

Just whoever ( … )ing controls it...

Just no place cold, all right?

Do that for me. I'm trying to--

He's bronchial, that's why.

Well, if he's legitimately bronchial,

we'll take that into consideration.

I'm legitimately bronchial.

I'd like to go someplace
that's not cold.

Okay, can I ask you some questions here?

What about my parents?

What about them?

Am I gonna see them?
Am I gonna talk to them?

I mean...

Don't I have some kind
of contact with them?

No.

No?

No. Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

You mean to tell me that,
God forbid, something happens
to my parents and they get sick,

I can't go and see them?

Maybe something can be worked out

if they're sick,

if there's some extraordinary
set of circumstances.

I can't do this.

I can't do this, Henry. I can't.

I can't leave my parents.

Excuse me. Karen, I told you before.

If you-- I-I'm not gonna do this

unless you and the kids come with me.

I-- I can't do it without you, okay?

So you do whatever, but...

that's it.

You need Henry.
You don't need me, right?

That's right.

And frankly, I don't care
whether you go or not.

If it's gonna make him
a happier witness,

a better witness,
I'd like you to be with him.

They want Henry. They don't want me.

But Henry's gonna be in
the witness protection program.

They're not gonna be able to get to him.

The only way they can get to him
is by getting to you

or getting to your kids.

If he goes into the program,
forget about it. You're in
a great deal of danger.

I don't know anything.

Come on. You don't know anything?

Don't give me the
babe-in-the-woods routine, Karen

I've listened to those wiretaps,

and I've heard you on the telephone.

You're talking about cocaine.

Conversation after conversation,

you're talking to Henry on the phone.

It doesn't matter,
because whether he goes to jail

or whether he stays on the street

and he beats the case,

he's a dead man.

He knows it, and you know it.

HENRY: What about the kids, with school?

KAREN: Do they get left back?
I mean, what goes on?

TUDDY: Why don't you guys
go down to Wall Street

and get some real ( … )in' crooks?

Whoever sold you those suits
had a wonderful sense of humor.

What it comes down to, Karen,

is we're basically your only salvation.

We're gonna save your life,
we're gonna save his life,

and we're gonna keep you out of jail.

(SIGHS)

MAN: This morning, you told
the members of this jury...

HENRY: It was easy
for all of us to disappear.

My house was in my mother-in-law's name.

My cars were registered to my wife.

My Social Security cards

and driver's licenses were phonies.

I never voted. I never paid taxes.

My birth certificate
and my arrest sheet--

that's all you'd ever have
to know I was alive.

ATTORNEY: Do you see him here
in the courtroom today?

Yes.

Can you please point him out
for the members of the jury?

Your Honor,
please let the record reflect

that Mr. Hill has identified
the defendant James Conway.

Do you also know a man

by the name of Paul Cicero?

Yes.

-Do you see him here
in the courtroom today?
-Yes.

Can you point him out
for the members of the jury?

Your Honor, let the record reflect

that Mr. Hill has identified
the defendant Paul Cicero.

Your Honor, I have a document
that I'd like to have marked...

See, the hardest thing for me
was leaving the life.

I still love the life.

I mean, we were treated
like movie stars with muscle.

We had it all just for the asking.

Our wives, mothers, kids,

everybody rode along.

I had paper bags filled with jewelry

stashed in the kitchen.

I had a sugar bowl
full of coke next to the bed.

People call 'em rats

'cause a rat will do
anything to survive.

Isn't that right?

-ATTORNEY: Objection!
-JUDGE: Objection sustained.

Uh, look, I don't know nothing
about being a rat.

You know everything about being a rat.

ATTORNEY: Objection, Your Honor.
In view of the violence...

Anything I wanted
was a phone call away--

free cars, the keys
to a dozen hideout flats

all over the city.

I'd bet 20, 30 grand over a weekend,

and then I'd either blow
the winnings in a week

or go to the sharks
to pay back the bookies.

Didn't matter.

It didn't mean anything.

When I was broke,

I would go out and rob some more.

We ran everything.

We paid off cops. We paid off lawyers.

We paid off judges.

Everybody had their hands out.
Everything was for the taking.

And now it's all over.

And that's the hardest part.

Today everything is different.
There's no action.

I have to wait around
like everyone else.

Can't even get decent food.

Right after I got here,

I ordered some spaghetti
with marinara sauce,

and I got egg noodles and ketchup.

I'm an average nobody.

I get to live the rest
of my life like a shnook.
