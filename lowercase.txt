CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE

Jimmy.

What's up?

Did I hit something?

What the ( … ) is that?

Is there a flat?

W--no.

What the ( … ).
You better pull over and see.

No, no, no, Tommy.

Henry: As far back as I can remember,

I always wanted to be a gangster.

♪ I know I'd go
from rags to riches ♪

♪ If you would only say you care ♪

♪ And though my pocket
may be empty ♪

♪ I'd be a millionaire ♪

♪ My clothes may still
be torn and tattered ♪

To me, being a gangster

was better than being president
of the United States.

♪ Your love is all
that ever matters ♪

Even before I first
wandered into the cab stand

for an after-school job,

I knew I wanted to be a part of them.

It was there that I knew
that I belonged.

To me it meant being somebody

in a neighborhood
that was full of nobodies.

They weren't like anybody else.

They did whatever they wanted.

They double-parked
in front of a hydrant.

Nobody ever gave them a ticket.

In the summer when they
played cards all night,

nobody ever called the cops.

♪ Must I forever be a beggar? ♪

Good, good, good.

Good to see you, Frankie.

Hey, Dr. Dan, how you doing?

Hey.

Hey.

How are you?

♪ Or will I go
from rags to riches? ♪

Tuddy Cicero.

Could this be the Canarsie Kid?

How are you?

Good, good.

Tuddy.

Minghia, Tuddy.

Tuddy ran the cab stand

and the Bella Vista Pizzeria

and a few other places
for his brother Paul

who was the boss over everybody
in the neighborhood.

Hello, Paulie.

Paulie might have moved slow...

but it was only because Paulie

didn't have to move for anybody.

♪ Must I forever be a beggar? ♪

It's your fault.

You started it.

I started it?

Hey, Junior, here.

At first my parents loved that
I found a job

across the street from the house.

My father, who was Irish,

was sent to work at the age of 11.

He liked that I got myself a job.

He always used to say American
kids were spoiled lazy.

Bye, Dad.

Bye. Take your lunch.

See you, Mikey.

Bye, Henry.

Henry, watch how you cross!

And bring back milk!

My mother was happy after
she found out that the Ciceros

came from the same part
of Sicily as she did.

To my mother, that was
the answer to all her prayers.

♪ Whoa-o-o-oh ♪

I was the luckiest kid in the world.

I could go anywhere, do anything.

I knew everybody, and everybody knew me.

Wiseguys would pull up,

and Tuddy would toss me their keys

and let me park their Cadillacs.

Here I am, this little kid.

I can't see over the steering wheel,

and I'm parking Cadillacs.

♪ Can't we be sweethearts? ♪

♪ Why don't we fall in love? ♪

But it wasn't too long before
my parents changed their minds

about my job at the cab stand.

This is for your mother and sister.

For them, the cab stand was
supposed to be a part-time job.

But for me, it was definitely full-time.

That's all I wanted to do.

See, people like my father
could never understand,

but I was a part of something.

I belonged.
I was treated like a grown-up.

Tell him 519.

Every day, I was learning to score.

A dollar here, a dollar there.

I was living in a fantasy.

Man: ( … ) his mother and his father.

Did you have a good day at school?

My father was always pissed off.

He was pissed that he made lousy money,

he was pissed
that my kid brother Michael

was in a wheelchair, he was pissed

that there were 7 of us
living in a tiny house.

Tell me about this.

It's a letter from school.

It says you haven't

been there in months.

In months!

You think you're so smart?

You want to grow up to be a bum?

But after a while, he was mostly pissed

because I hung around the cab stand.

He knew what went on at that cab stand,

and every once in a while,
I'd have to take a beating.

But by then I didn't care.

The way I saw it,

everybody takes a beating sometime.

Don't!

I can't make any deliveries.

What do you mean?
You'll ( … ) everything up.

My dad says he's gonna kill me. Look.

Come on with me.

Is that him there, kid?

No.

How about him?

Nope.

That's the guy.

Get him.

Excuse me.

Yeah?

Hey! Hey! Hey!

♪ No, no, no, no, no, no,
your daddy's home ♪

♪ I thought you... ♪

Know this kid?

Yeah.

You know where he lives?

Deliver mail to his house?

Yeah.

From now on any letter

from that school to that kid's house

comes directly here, understand?

If another letter from that school

goes to that kid's house,

in the ( … )in' oven you're gonna go!

That was it. No more letters

from truant officers,
no more letters from school.

In fact, no more letters from anybody.

Finally, my mother had to go
the post office and complain.

How could I go back to school after that

and pledge allegiance to the flag

and sit through
good government bull( … )?

♪ Will never break me ♪

Paulie hated phones.

He wouldn't have one in his house.

Mikey called. Want me to call him back?

Make the call. Go ahead.

He used to get all his calls secondhand.

Then you'd call the people back
from an outside phone.

Got a nickel? Get him on the phone.

There were guys, that's all they did,

all day long, was take care
of Paulie's phone calls.

Yeah, yeah.

All right, right.

Just like this.

What a dog.

For a guy who moved all day long,

Paulie didn't talk to 6 people.

If there was a union problem
or a beef in the numbers,

only the top guys can meet
with Paulie to discuss it.

Everything was one-on-one.
Paulie hated conferences.

He didn't want
anybody hearing what he said.

He didn't want anybody
listening to what he was told.

Hundreds of guys depended on Paulie.

He got a piece of everything they made.

It was tribute like in the old country

except they were doing it
here in America.

All they got from Paulie

was protection from other guys
looking to rip them off.

That's what it's all about.

That's what the FBI
could never understand,

that what Paulie
and the organization does

is offer protection for people
who can't go to the cops.

That's it. That's all it is.

They're like the police
department for wiseguys.

[Crash]

People looked at me differently.

They knew I was with somebody.

I didn't have to
wait in line at the bakery

on Sunday mornings anymore
for fresh bread.

The owner knew who I was with

and he'd come from around the counter.

No matter how many people were waiting,

I was taken care of first.

Our neighbors didn't park
in our driveway anymore,

even though we didn't have a car.

At 13, I was making more money
than most of the grown-ups.

I had more money than I
could spend. I had it all.

One day...

One day, some of the kids
from the neighborhood

carried my mother's groceries
all the way home.

You know why? It was out of respect.

Hi, Mom. What do you think?

Look at my shoes. Aren't they great?

My God, you look like a gangster.

They shot me! Help!

[Italian opera playing]

Henry, shut the door!

Jesus! Can't have that in here.

Jesus Christ, I can't
have that in this joint.

I remember feeling bad about the guy,

but I also remember feeling
that maybe Tuddy was right.

I knew Paulie didn't want
anybody dying in the building.

You're a real jerk.

You wasted 8 ( … )in' aprons
on this guy.

What the hell's wrong with you?
I gotta toughen this kid up.

It was a glorious time,

and wiseguys were all over the place.

It was before Appalachin
and before Crazy Joe

decided to take on a boss
and start a war.

It was when I met the world.

It was when I first met Jimmy Conway.

He couldn't have been
more than 28, 29 at the time,

but he was already a legend.

He'd walk in the door,

and everybody who worked
the room just went wild.

He'd give the doorman a hundred
just for opening the door.

He'd shove hundreds
in the pockets of the dealers

and all the guys that ran the games.

The bartender got a hundred
for keeping the ice cubes cold.

The Irishman is here
to take all you guineas' money.

You want a drink?

Seven and Seven.

♪ Oh, they often call me Speedo ♪

Jimmy, I'd like you
to meet the kid Henry.

How you doing? Pleasure.

Thank you.

Keep it coming.

Jimmy was one of the most
feared guys in the city.

He was first locked up at 11.

He was doing hits
for mob bosses when he was 16.

Hits never bothered Jimmy.
It was business.

But what Jimmy really loved to do...

what he really loved to do was steal.

I mean, he actually enjoyed it.

Jimmy was the kind of guy

who rooted for the bad guys
in the movies.

Give me your wallet.

You might know who we are,
but we know who you are.

He was one of
the city's biggest hijackers

of booze, cigarettes, razor blades,

shrimp, and lobsters.

Shrimp and lobsters were best.
They went really fast.

Almost all of them were gimmies.

They gave it up, no problem.

They called him Jimmy the Gent.

Tommy, help the lady.

The drivers loved him.

They'd tip him off
about really good loads,

and everybody got a piece.

I'll be back with the rest later.

See you later.

Henry, come here.

Say hello to Tommy.

Youse're gonna be working together, OK?

OK. Sounds good.

Hey, Jimmy, you got anything good?

And when the cops
assigned an army to stop Jimmy,

what did he do?

He made them partners.

Jimmy, I'd complain, but who'd listen?

Give me one Pall Mall.

I'll take 2 Luckies.

2 Luckies. Here you go.

Thanks.

One Pall Mall.

Here you go.

Whoa, what are you doing?

It's all right.

You got permission from your mother?

How many cartons you need?

Where did you get those cigarettes?

Get him outta here.

It's OK.

It's not OK.

No, you don't understand!

You don't understand. Store's closed!

[Italian opera playing]

Henry got pinched.

Where?

By the factory.

For selling cigarettes.

Henry Hill.

The People of the State
of New York vs. Henry Hill.

Docket number 704162.

Uh, yes, sir. That's me.

Come on.

Just stand there.

Now, stay there.

Counselor, proceed.

Hey, Jimmy.

Congratulations.

Here's your graduation present.

What for? I got pinched.

Everybody gets pinched,
but you did it right.

You told them nothing
and they got nothing.

I thought you'd be mad.

I'm not mad. I'm proud of you.

You took your first pinch like a man

and learned the 2
greatest things in life.

What?

Look at me.

Never rat on your friends...

and always keep your mouth shut.

Hey, here he is! Here he is!

Oh, you broke your cherry!

Henry!

Congratulations, kid!

By the time I grew up,

there was 30 billion a year in cargo

moving through Idlewild
Airport, and believe me,

we tried to steal every bit of it.

You gotta understand,

we grew up near the airport.
It belonged to Paulie.

We had friends and relatives
who worked all over the place.

They would tip us off

about what was coming in and moving out.

If any truckers or airlines
gave us any trouble,

Paulie had his union people
scare them with a strike.

It was beautiful, an even
bigger moneymaker than numbers,

and Jimmy was in charge of it all.

Whenever we needed money,
we'd rob the airport.

To us, it was better than Citibank.

♪ You were in my arms ♪

♪ The nightingale
tells his fairy tale ♪

Hey, you got a phone? Come on!

2 ( … )s just stole my truck!

You ( … )in' believe that?

There was Jimmy and Tommy and me,

and there was Anthony Stabile.

Hey, how are you doing?

Frankie Carbone.

Che dice? Come se va.

And then there was
Mo Black's brother Fat Andy.

How are you doing, buddy?

And his guys, Frankie the Wop...

Are you staying out of trouble?

Freddy No Nose...

And then there was Pete the Killer,

who was Sally Balls' brother.

I took care of that thing for ya.

Then you had Nickey Eyes...

What's up, guy?

And Mikey Franzese.

I saw that guy. Yeah, I wanna see him.

And Jimmy Two Times
who got that nickname

because he said everything twice, like...

I'm going to go get the papers,
get the papers.

Vinnie, they'll be out of style

by the time we get this thing going.

Watch the wall.

Coming through. Watch it.

Come on, Vinnie. We got coats.

I need suits, Henry, not coats.

Suits are, uh, coming Thursday.

I know, but this is
the ( … )in' summer.

What am I gonna do with fur coats?

I'll take the furs away.

No, don't take 'em. I want them.

We'll hang them in the freezer
with the meat. How's that?

For us, to live any other way was nuts.

To us, those goody-good people
who worked ( … )ty jobs

for bum paychecks and took
the subway to work every day

and worried about their bills were dead.

They were suckers. They had no balls.

If we wanted something, we just took it.

If anyone complained twice,

they got hit so bad
they never complained again.

It was just all routine.
You didn't even think about it.

I can never hit that number.

Frankie, what the ( … ) does 528

have to do with 460?

I can't believe this guy.

( … )in' 528 ain't even close to 460.

What the ( … ) has that got
to do with anything?

I've been playing that number

for 3 years.

Hey, Henry.

Piece of cake. It's all there.

Don't worry about the alarms.

Just gotta find a way to get the key.

I'll take care of it.

How are you doing? Good to see you.

Tell him what you
were telling me, Frenchy.

Too good to be true.

Ha ha!

Big score coming from Air France.

Bags of money like this comin' in

from tourists and American servicemen

who changed their money over

into French money, sent it back here.

Shh. Calm down.

It's beautiful.

It's totally untraceable, OK?

The only problem is getting a key.

But I got something all worked out.

This guy's a piece of work.

If I'm right, there could be

half a mil coming in,

all cash.

He said the best time
is probably over the weekend.

They don't have things organized.

I've got things organized

with these guys.

You know who goes to jail?

( … ) stick-up men, that's who.

You know why they caught?

Because they fall asleep

in the getaway car.

Come on, don't worry so much, sweetie.

Come here.

After a while, it got to be all normal.

None of it seemed like crime.

It was more like Henry was enterprising

and that he and the guys were
making a few bucks hustling

while the other guys
were sitting on their asses

waiting for handouts.

Our husbands weren't brain surgeons.

They were blue-collar guys.

The only way they made extra money

was to go out and cut a few corners.

Where's the strongbox,
you ( … )in' varmint?

Easy.

Take him easy.

All right. All right.

Don't ( … )in' move!

Take it easy. Take it easy.

Come on.

OK, Frankie.

Get in the ( … )in' car!

Here's your hat, you ( … ).

See you guys at the diner.

I'm riding shotgun!

Henry: Did you see him? Ha ha ha ha!

Tommy: Back to the hideout
and split up the loot!

[Firing gun]

Whoo! Ha!

Karen: We were all so very close.

I mean, there were never
outsiders around,

absolutely never.

Being together all the time

made everything seem
all the more normal.

Hello, Mrs. Hill. I'm Detective Deacy.

This is Detective Silvestri.

We've got a search
warrant for the premise.

Could you sign it?

Anywhere?

Yeah. Anywhere.

It's going to take a while.

You boys want some coffee?

No. Thanks, anyway.

All right. Just be careful.

We'll go about our business.

There was always a little harassment.

They always wanted to talk
to Henry about this or that.

They'd come in with
subpoenas and warrants.

Mostly, they were just
looking for a handout,

a few bucks to keep things quiet

no matter what they found.

[Whistling]

I always asked them
if they wanted coffee.

Some wives, like Mickey Conway,

used to curse at them
and spit on the floor.

She used to spit on her own floor.

That never made any sense to me.

It was better to be polite
and call the lawyer.

♪ Good-bye, Tootsie, good-bye ♪♪

♪ Happy birthday to you ♪♪

We always did everything together,

and we always were in the same crowd--

anniversaries, christenings.

We only went to each other's houses.

The women played cards,

and when the kids were born,

Mickey and Jimmy were the first
at the hospital.

When we went to the islands
or Vegas for vacation,

we always went together.

No outsiders. Ever.

It got to be normal.

I was even proud
I had the kind of husband

who was willing to go out
and risk his neck

just to get us the little extras.

But I got my mom to watch
the babies tomorrow!

Can't do it, Karen. Why not?

I just can't. I got something lined up.

Tomorrow night's
the only night she can do it.

Pretty please?

Karen, I can't do it. What do you want?

I got to go.

Wait a minute!

I wanted to go shopping.

Can I get some money?

How much do you need?

How much?

That much.

What? Here.

This much. Give me a kiss.

Here.

See you later.

No.

Uh, oh...

Top of the morning to you.

Welcome back.

This is my friend Jimmy.

Hello.

Henry. It's his joint.

This is Lisa.

Hey, Tommy. All dressed up.

All grown up and doing the town.

Oh, ( … ) Tommy!

I forgot this mouth was having a party.

Oh! Oh! Come here!

Let me say hello. Hey, Billy.

Tommy, I haven't seen you
in 6 ( … )in' years.

How you doing?

Jesus Christ Almighty.
You look terrific.

How you feeling?

Watch the suit!

Watch the suit. You little prick.

I know you all my life.

All right. Good.

Just don't go bustin' my ( … )s, okay?

Hey, if I was going to break your ( … )s,

I'd tell you to go home
and get your shine box.

This kid was great.

They used to call him
Spitshine Tommy. Swear to God.

He'd make your shoes
look like ( … )in' mirrors.

Excuse my language.

He was the best.
He made a lot of money, too.

Salute, Tommy.

No more shines, Billy.

What?

I said no more shines.
Maybe you didn't hear.

You've been away a long time.

I don't shine shoes anymore.

Relax, will you? What's got into you?

I'm breakin' your ( … )s
a little. I'm only kidding.

Sometimes you don't sound
like you're kidding.

There's a lotta people around.

Tommy, I'm only kidding.
I just came home.

I haven't seen you,
I'm breakin' your ( … )s,

and right away,
you're getting ( … )in' fresh.

I'm sorry. I don't mean to offend you.

I'm sorry, too. No problem.

Okay. Salute.

Now go home and get your

You--you ( … )in' piece of ( … )!

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on! Come on!

Henry, he bought his ( … )in' button!

You bought your ( … )in' button!

Don't get nervous. Don't
get nervous. Let him come.

Keep that mother( … )er here.

Let him go.

Batts. Batts.

Come on! You ( … )in' feel strong?

I'm sorry. Tommy gets a little loaded.

He doesn't mean any disrespect.

Doesn't mean any disrespect?
Are you nuts?

Jimmy, what's right is right.

You understand?

It's all right. It's all right.
