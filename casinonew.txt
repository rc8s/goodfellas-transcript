MAN (narrating): When you love
someone,

you've gotta trust them. There's no other way.

You've got to give them the key
to everything that's yours.

Otherwise, what's the point?

And, for a while,

I believe that's the kind of love I had.

♪♪ (choir singing)

Before I ever ran a casino
or got myself blown up,

Ace Rothstein was
a hell of a handicapper,

I can tell you that.

I was so good that whenever I bet,

I could change the odds for
every bookmaker in the country.

I'm serious, I had it down so cold

that I was given paradise on earth.

I was given one of the biggest casinos

in Las Vegas to run, the Tangiers,

by the only kind of guys that can actually
get you that kind of money--

$62,700,000.

I don't know all the details.

MAN 2 (narrating): Matter of fact,

nobody knew all the details.

But it should have been perfect.

I mean, he had me, Nicky Santoro,

his best friend, watching his (...).

And he had Ginger,
the woman he loved, on his arm.

But in the end,

we (...)ed it all up.

It should've been so sweet, too.

But it turned out to be the last
time that street guys like us

were ever given anything
that (...)in' valuable again.

ACE: At that time, Vegas was a place
where millions of suckers

flew in every year on their own nickel

and left behind about a billion dollars.

But at night, you couldn't see the desert

that surrounds Las Vegas.

But it's in the desert where lots
of the town's problems are solved.

NICKY: Got a lot of holes in the desert,

and a lot of problems are buried in those holes.

Except you gotta do it right.

I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug

before you show up with
a package in the trunk.

Otherwise, you're talking about

a half hour or 45 minutes of diggin',

and who knows who's gonna be
comin' along in that time?

Before you know it,
you gotta dig a few more holes.

You could be there all (...)in' night.

(tires screeching, horn honking)

ACE: Who could resist?

Anywhere else in the country
I was a bookie, a gambler,

always looking over my shoulder,
hassled by cops day and night.

But here I'm Mr. Rothstein.

I'm not only legitimate,
but running a casino,

and that's like selling people
dreams for cash.

I hired an old casino pal,
Billy Sherbert,

as my manager, and I went to work.

(indistinct conversation)

For guys like me, Las Vegas
washes away your sins.

It's like a morality car wash.

It does for us what Lourdes does

for humpbacks and cripples.

And along with making us legit

comes cash, tons of it.

I mean, what do you think
we're doing out here

in the middle of the desert?

It's all this money.

This is the end result of all the bright lights
and the comp trips,

of all the champagne
and free hotel suites

and all the broads and all the booze.

It's all been arranged just
for us to get your money.

That's the truth about Las Vegas.

We're the only winners.

The players don't stand a chance.

And their cash flows from the tables

to the boxes through the cage

and into the most sacred room
in the casino.

The place where they
add up all the money--

the holy of holies, the count room.

Now, this place was off-limits.

Even I couldn't get inside.

But it was my job

to keep it filled with cash,
that's for sure.

NICKY: They had
so much (...)in' money in there

you could build a house out of stacks

of hundred-dollar bills.

And the best part was that upstairs

the board of directors didn't know

what the (...) was going on.

I mean, to them, everything
looked on the up and up.

Right? Wrong.

The guys inside the counting room...

were all slipped in there
to skim the joint dry.

They'd do short counts,
they'd lose fill slips.

They'd even take cash
right out of the drop boxes.

And it was up to this guy right here,

standin' in front of about $2 million,

to skim the cash off the top
without anybody getting wise,

the IRS or anybody.

Now, notice how in the count room

nobody ever seems to see anything.

Somehow somebody's always
looking the other way.

Now, look at these guys. They look busy, right?

They're countin' money.
Who wants to bother them?

I mean, God forbid
they should make a mistake

and forget to steal.

Meanwhile, you're in and you're out.

Past the jag-off guard
who gets an extra C-note a week

just to watch the door.

I mean, it's routine. Business as usual--

in, out, hello, goodbye,
and that's all there is to it.

Just another fat (...)

walkin' out of the casino
with a suitcase.

Now, that suitcase was going straight to one place--

right to Kansas City,

which was as close to Las Vegas
as the Midwest bosses could go

without gettin' themselves arrested.

That suitcase was all
the bosses ever wanted,

and they wanted it every month.

Now, this old Mormon (...) here,

he had to fly in with suitcases
once a month, nice and easy.

Something smells good.

Yeah, they made us something to eat.

The bosses would come
from all over the place--

Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee,
all over the Midwest.

And they would meet in the back
of this produce market in Kansas City.

I mean, nobody even knew.

One of the guys made his mother
do all the cooking.

Did you ever see that guy Jerry Steriano?

Jerry Steriano?

Now, these old greaseballs
might not lookit,

but believe me, these are the guys

who secretly control Las Vegas.

Mama, that man's here again.

Because they control
the Teamsters' union,

and that's where you had to go
if you wanted to borrow money

to buy a casino.

Nobody got a Teamsters loan
unless the guys in this room

knew they were going to get
their little suitcases.

Guys like this antique
over here, out of Detroit.

Or especially guys like Remo Gaggi,

the outfit's top boss.

You got a round figure on it?

Definitely the most
important guy in this room.

About 20 pounds.

So?

That's around $700,000.

Uh-huh. Of course.

MAN: I know it's
a little early for Las Vegas...

(audience laughter)

...but I do want to welcome
the ladies and gentlemen

of the gaming industry.

ACE: As far as the world
was concerned, Andy Stone,

the head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund,

was a legitimate guy.

A powerful man.

He even played golf with the president.

ANDY: On behalf of
the Teamsters' Pension Fund,

it is my pleasure to present you...

ACE: But Andy also took orders.

And when he was told to give

a pension fund loan to Phillip Green...

...he did what he was told.

NICKY: Now, here was
the perfect front man.

I mean, what the (...) else could he be?

He didn't know too much. He
didn't want to know too much.

Especially that the bosses

made the Teamsters lend him the money.

He wanted to believe the Teamsters

gave him all that (...)in' money
'cause he was smart.

I say that knowing full well
just how much competition

we have in this great city.

And where they got Green from?

Who the (...) knows?

All I know is that Green was
an Arizona real estate hustler

who barely had enough gas money

to come and pick up
his own (...)in' check.

And of course it was the boss's man,

Andy Stone, who gave all the orders,

not the chairman of the
(...)in' board, Phillip Green.

I understand. I understand.

Now all they needed

was somebody they could trust
to run the casino,

and who better than Ace?

I mean, he was already
in Vegas a couple of years,

and he had the (...)in' place clocked.

But typical Ace,

give him a shot at running a casino,

and he tries to talk you out of it.

I don't know if I could do this even if I wanted to.

The Gaming Commission
would never give me a license.

I have at least two dozen

gambling and bookmaking pinches on me.

You don't have to have a
license to work in a casino.

All you gotta do is apply for one.

The state law says that
you can work in a casino

while they're processing your application.

They got a ten-year backlog.

But what happens when they do find out?

Why would they want to find out?

We're putting $100 million
into this desert here.

Why would they want to lock us out?

And besides, they'll never find out.

All you got to do is keep
changing your job title,

like, uh, from Casino Executive
to Food and Beverage Chairman.

And what happens is they take your application,

they put it at the bottom of the pile.

I know guys been working there for 30 years

don't have a license.

(sighs) It's a tough proposition, Andy.

You know if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.

You got it.

I'm serious, no interference.

Nobody's going to interfere
with your running the casino.

I guarantee it.

♪ Everybody start to sing ♪

♪ La-di-da, oh... ♪

NICKY: And that's how they got Ace to take over.

They wanted him because Ace ate, slept,

and breathed gambling.

They worked out
a real cute job title too--

Tangiers Public Relations Director.

But the only thing he ever
directed was the casino.

He made his first bet
when he was 15 years old,

and he always made money.

But he didn't bet like you or me.

You know, having some fun
with it, (...) like that.

He bet like a (...)in' brain surgeon.

He had to know everything, this guy.

He'd find out the kind of
inside stuff nobody else knew,

and that's what he'd put his money on.

♪ Everybody knows I'm him ♪

Even back home, years ago,

when we were first hanging out together,

he'd know if the quarterback
was on coke...

...if his girlfriend was knocked up.

...20 dimes on Columbia...

He'd get the wind velocity so
he could judge the field goals.

He even figured out
the difference bounce you got

off the different kinds of wood they used

on college basketball courts, you know?

He'd be working on this (...)
day and night.

There was nothing about a game

he was gonna bet that he didn't know.

Ace got down at six. Get me down at six.

Season after season,

the prick was the only
guaranteed winner I ever knew.

But he was so serious about it all

that I don't think
he ever enjoyed himself.

But that's just the way he was.

But back then,
the bosses didn't give a (...)

about whether he enjoyed himself or not.

To them, he was a cash register.

All they had to do was ring
the bell and take the money.

Especially Remo,

who was a (...)in' degenerate
gambler who always lost.

(curses, mutters in Italian)

All those (...)ing sweeps...

I mean, unless Ace made his bets.

Ace made more money for them on a weekend

than I could do
heisting joints for a month.

Whatever Ace picked up
on the street he told Remo.

You know, I mean, fixed fights, doped horses,

crooked (...)in' zebras,
locked-in point spreads--

he told (...)in' Remo everything.

And to tell you the truth,
I don't blame him.

Keeping Remo happy with money

was the greatest
insurance policy in the world.

Son of a (...).

How the hell did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?

Nobody ever had Oklahoma-Mi...
How the hell did you do it?

Well, that's why they paid so well.

You see? Never tells me nothing.

Ace, what do we got on for next week?

Well, it's a little too early.
I'd say Thursday would be good.

I'll know by then. Is that all right?

Okay. You come by the house?

I'll come by.

7:00.

Good job, my boy. Keep it up. Okay, Ace.

Hey, Nicky. Vien acca.

I'll be right out.

(speaks Italian) Nicky, see that guy?

Keep a good eye on him.

He's making a lot of money for us,

and he's gonna continue making
a lot of money for us,

so keep a good eye on him.

Not like your (...)ing friends
out there that-- without brains.

Okay? Okay.

All right.

Mi raccomando.

Yeah.

All right.

NICKY: So now, on top of everything else,

I gotta make sure nobody (...)s

MAN: Chase, a couple

ACE: Yeah, we made a great pair.

I made book, and Nicky made
sure we always collected.

The old men loved us, and why not?

They all made money with us.

How did Nicky collect?

Don't ask.

NICKY: Well, where the (...)

WOMAN: Hi, Sam.

Hi, Melissa, Heidi.

NICKY: You laid nine?

Yeah, I laid nine.

NICKY: It was eight.

eight? It was nine. I laid nine.

It was eight. Ace,

tell him the line on the bear game.

Eight.

If he don't know, nobody knows.

I told you it was eight.

Well, how come I laid nine?

'Cause you're a jag-off.

Excuse me.

What?

Is this yours? Your pen?

Yeah, that's my pen. Why?

No, it's a nice pen. I just
didn't know whose it was.

I thought it was yours.

I didn't want it to get lost or...

Well, thank you.

Why don't you take that (...)ing

ACE: While I was trying
to figure out why the guy

was saying what he was saying,
Nicky just hit him.

No matter how big a guy might be,

Nicky would take him on.

You beat Nicky with fists,
he comes back with a bat.

You beat him with a knife,
he comes back with a gun,

And if you beat him with a gun,
you better kill him,

because he'll keep coming back and back

until one of you is dead.

He's the county commissioner's cousin.

I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.

But still, I had no choice.
I had to take care of them.

These yokels ran the state.

Thank you very much, Senator.

They passed the laws,

they owned the courts.

I had dozens of politicians
and state officials

coming through that place every week.

Help the Senator, get him whatever he wants.

Certainly.

Why not make him happy?

(indistinct conversation)

For politicians like
our State Senator up there,

everything was on the house.

These guys won their comp life
when they got elected, so hey,

why not take advantage of it?

Still, the politicians came
cheap. We could handle them.

It's a whale like K. K. Ichikawa,

who plays $30,000 a hand in baccarat.

That's the one you really got to watch.

He plays fast and big,

and he has the cash and the
credit to turn out your lights.

About a year ago he cleaned
out a couple of casinos

in the Cayman Islands.

Downstairs he takes us for $2 million,

and upstairs he takes
free soap, shampoo, and towels.

Another billionaire cheapskate

who loved his free rooms, free private jets,

and two million of our money.

But we got him back.

I had our pilot tell him
the plane was on the fritz.

I don't know what the hell
went wrong. I'm awfully sorry.

I can't understand it.

These mechanical things, you know they happen.

Hey, but better here than, uh,
up there, you know what I mean?

Then he missed the commercial
flights connecting with Japan.

Convention? I can't believe that
there's a convention. There's never--

We got him back with a whole
floor of rooms to himself.

I'm sorry you missed your plane.

I'll get my money back, right?

Oh, no, no. No gambling. No gambling.

And once he was back, he played small.

He bet $1,000 a hand instead
of his usual $30,000 a hand.

But I knew the trick with
whales like Ichikawa

was that they can't bet small for long.

He didn't think of it as winning $10,000,

he thought of it as losing $90,000.

So he upped his bets...

Ginger had the hustler's code.

Thank you.

She knew how to take care of people,

and that's what Vegas is all about.

$6,800.

It's kickback city.

You have a good night.

Thank you. You too.

She took care of the dealers,

pit bosses, floor managers,

but mostly, she took care
of the valet parkers,

the guys who could get you anything

and take care of anything.

Thank you, Ginger.

Ginger took care of the parkers

because they took care of
the security guards,

who took care of the metro
cops who let her operate.

I need that stuff tonight.

No problem.

The valet parking job was such a moneymaker

they had to pay off the hotel manager

just to get the concession.

But one thing I just
could never understand

was that she could have
everything under control

except for her old pimp
boyfriend, Lester Diamond.

Look, Gin, you know I got other
people in this. I got partners.

But I want you to understand
that I am looking out for you in this thing, okay?

You're going to get yours back,

and you're gonna get it back first, okay?

Okay. Yeah.

Where you going?

Where are you? You're in
that place. Where are you?

I'm here.

No, you're not. Where are you?

Where are you?

I'm always here for you.

You are.

I am.

The Ginger I knew wouldn't even
look at this creep.

Good luck.

Yeah.

He was a moocher, a card cheat,

a country-club golf hustler, a scumbag,

chasing dentists for a few bucks.

Careful.

I mean, the guy was always
broke. He always had a story.

And somehow, she could never turn him down.

The way Ginger saw it, I guess,

was that Lester was just an unlucky guy.

Somebody had to take care of him.

But nobody had to take care of Nicky.

You find any cash in there,
we'll whack it up with you.

I mean, he took care of himself
only too well.

And that's why every badge
back home wanted to nail him.

I folded these things beautifully,

and I would appreciate a little respect.

Don't look at me, pal. I got to live with her.

Even after a little vacation,

they hassled him at the airport.

I mean, Frank Marino
was there to meet him,

but so were the cops.

This time they wanted to pinch him

for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.

They were ready
to blame him for anything,

no matter where it happened.

Remember, put your things away.

And they were usually right.

Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster,

and he didn't give a (...) who knew it.

Come on.

There we go. Look at this. Beautiful!

I mean, that's what worried me.

'Cause it turns out Nicky
was about to be sent to Vegas.

All right, we're clear.

There's more.

I think that's it.

There's more.

There's a couple stuck in there.
I know there's more.

I'm telling you, they're out.

Come on-- Don't get so defensive.

It could be stuck in your hair, you know.

I'm not defensive.

There aren't. There--

Oh, there aren't? Look.

What's that? Huh? What's that?

There's no more. Thanks, hon.

NICKY: I couldn't wait
to get my hands on Vegas.

But the bosses didn't send me

They're dear friends of mine.

Good to meet you.

Hi, Jennifer.

Pleasure. Nice to meet you.

Okay, Sammy.

ACE: After we ate, we left
Jennifer and Ginger alone,

and we took a ride to talk.

And then, he hit me with it.

What do you think about me moving out here?

What's the matter? You got a problem with that?

No, of course not.

You mean I have your permission?

Sure, you have my permission.

But I-I just gotta tell you,
it's no joke out here. It's no joke.

You know, you gotta...
you gotta keep a low profile.

It's not like back home.

Right off the bat they don't like guys like us.

And this sheriff's a real cowboy.

Even the coppers aren't afraid

to bury people out in the desert here.

I don't care. I want to get away
from back home for a while.

I'm tired of that (...) back there.

Look at this place. It's made of money.

You know what the best part is?

Nobody's gonna know what we're doing.

There's nobody here to see us.
Everybody's back home.

Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched
twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful.

I'm running a licensed place.
Everything's legit.

Don't worry about it.
I'm not gonna do anything.
What am I gonna do?

a foolproof scheme all right.

It wasn't very scientific, but it worked.

When he won, he collected.

When he lost, he told the
bookies to go (...) themselves.

What were they gonna do, muscle Nicky?

(chuckles) Nicky was the muscle.

Tony. How you doing? How you doing?

All right, yeah.

You got that thing for me?

What thing?
Oh, Nicky, I thought you was layin'.

I was layin'?
No, no, I'm taking it. I was taking it.

You sure?

I'm positive.

Well, I'm a little confused here.

You're a little confused?

Maybe if I stick your (...)in' face

through this window over here,
like, you know,

you'll-you'll get unconfused.
Give me the (...)in' money.

I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't
mean anything by it.

Yeah, I know, that's why you had it ready.

You thought I was (...)in' layin' it?

Ow. My (...)in' head.

Your (...)in' head, huh?

Smarten up.

NICKY: Don't (...) around, Tony, jag-off.

And now Nicholas Santoro
will come up and tell us
about our first president.

George Washington was born...

ACE: But still, it was nice
and quiet for a while.

Ginger and I presented Nicky
and Jennifer all over town

like regular Ozzie and Harriets.

LITTLE NICKY: ...Virginia farm house.

MAN: Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing.

NICKY: Ace got my son,

Little Nicky, involved with
Little League, and it was great.

Turned out to be one of the other coaches

was a (...)in' metro intelligence cop.

But it didn't matter.

I mean, it was all about
the kids, you know.

You know, he's got to realize
everything can't be

a home run that he does.

Yeah. That's exactly what
I keep telling him,

but that's the kind of kid
he is. Ever since he's born,

he tried to do everything...

It's instinctive.

ACE: And Nicky, being Nicky,

he made his presence known.

Especially at the casino, where
he definitely did not work,

people got the message.

NICKY: Me, that's why
the bosses sent me out here.

They wanted me to make sure

none of the other crews robbed the joint.

Like these two (...)in'
balloon heads over here.

They were gonna try to bang us
out of 200 (...)in' grand?

Yeah, right, I'm sure.

Hey, Eddy.

How are you? What are you doing here?

I'm over here now.

BOTH: You're over here?

You're over here?

Yeah, I'm over here with them.

Whoa.

We're waiting on Carmine.

Yeah, we're looking for Carmine.

Carmine?

He was here before. I saw him.

He had his suitcase and everything,
and then he left.

Carmine left?

Uh-huh.

Carmine left?

He's gone?

He's not here?

Carmine's gone?

I think, you know, maybe
he went across the street

or somewhere else or something.
I don't know.

Well, listen, uh...

good luck with the joint, huh?

Oh, thanks, Eddy.

Yeah. Lots of luck. Lots of luck.

All right, Jerry. Good luck to you too.

MAN: Hey, they forgot to sign their papers.

What?

They forgot to sign their papers.

Yeah, they don't need those anymore.

ACE: Out of respect,

guys from other crews
got away with a warning.

Everybody else, watch out.

Like these yokels right here,

who never heard of Nicky
or the bosses back home.

'Cause they're the morons who
give you the most trouble.

Even after we'd catch them,
they'd try sneaking back

with beards and wigs and fake noses.

You can spot these (...)holes
by watching the way they bet.

Like this guy.

He's betting lavender chips at $500 each

with only one little problem--
he's always guessed right.

If he wasn't so (...)ing greedy,
he'd have been tougher to spot.

But in the end, they're all greedy.

He's fine, folks. Just give us some room, please.

GUARD: Watch it, now. Step back.

They never know what hit them.

Got a wire on him.

Hey, hey, what are you doing, man? Agh!

There it is. That's it.

On the table.

Cheater's justice.

Oh, God! (groans)

(whirring)

Hey, no! No!

No!

I wanted everybody to know

that things were changed around here.

We had to make an example of these pricks

that the party was over.

I'm just curious.

I saw you shuffling your
checks with your right hand.

Can you do that with both hands?

N-no.

Can't do it with both hands?

No, sir.

Can you do it with your left hand?

Uh, well, I-I never tried.

So you're a righty.

Y-yeah.

(screaming)

(groans)

Now you're gonna have
to learn with your left hand.

(continues groaning)

MAN: It's $100. $110, I think.

Yes, it is. Yes.

Okay.

Hiya.

That's a lot of money to
be counting out in public.

Why don't I take him over to
the office and verify it, huh?

A little privacy. And by the way, send over
a nice bottle of champagne on ice, huh?

Sure will.

Real special. By the way,
I'm Billy Sherbert,

you know, casino manager.

Having a good time?

Yes. Uh--

You'll want to count the money
in privacy, you know...

Uh, I have a plane to catch to Cleveland.

Can I get my winnings?

Look what they did to my hand, man.

All right, I'm gonna give you a choice.

You can either have
the money and the hammer,

or you can walk out of here.
You can't have both. What do you want?

I just want to get out of here.

And don't forget to tell
your friends what happens

if they (...) around here. You understand?

I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.

You're (...)in' right you made a bad mistake.

'Cause if you come back here,
we catch either one of you,

we're gonna break your (...)in' heads,
and you won't walk out of here.

You see that (...)in' saw? We're gonna use it.

You don't (...) around
in this place. You got it?

Yeah.

Get out of here.

Thank you.

Throw him out in the alley
and just tell the cops he got hit by a car.

ACE: Within no time,
everything was set in place.

We got rid of the freelance scamsters,

the per was way up, the gods were happy,

or as happy as the gods can ever be,

and I, I decided to complicate my life.

For a guy who likes sure things,

I was about to bet the rest
of my life on a real long shot.

We're not getting any younger.

Don't you think it's time?

Aren't you getting tired of all this (...)?

Banging around, hustling around?

What, are you trying to handicap me?

I'm gonna do you one better.

I'm trying to marry you.

You want to marry me?

I'm serious.

I mean, I want to settle down.
I want a family.

(chuckles) You got the wrong girl.

Sam...

I know I'd be a good father.
I know you'd be a good mother.

You don't know me. You've
known me two, three months.

What do you know?

I'm 43 years old. I don't want to wait.

I know you well enough
to know that I really love you very much,

and I can't think
of anybody better to be with.

And I don't feel like waiting anymore.

You know a lot of
happily married people, Sam?

'Cause I don't.

Yeah, I know all that.

(sighs)

I care about you.

But I just don't have
those kind of feelings for you.

I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.

I-I-I...

Understand?

I'm sorry.

No, I-I...

I mean...

that can grow.

As-as long as there's a mutual respect,

that kind of thing can grow.

I'm realistic.

I can accept that.

But, you know, what is...
what is love anyway?

It's a, it's a mutual respect.
It's-it's a devotion.

It's a... it's a caring
from one person to another.

And if we could set up
some kind of foundation

based on that mutual respect,

I feel that eventually
you would care enough about me

that I could live with that.

If it doesn't work out, you
know, if it doesn't play out,

then what happens to me?

You know I'm doing well now,
and I'm gonna do even better.

And so, whatever happens,

if it doesn't work out between us,

I'm going to make sure you're
okay for the rest of your life.

And if there are kids, especially,

you know, I'll take care of you
better than you'd ever imagine.

I-- What are you pitching me?

Just what I said.

You'll be set up for the rest of your life.

That I can promise you.

Want to take a chance?

(applause)

When I married Ginger,
I knew all the stories.

But I didn't give a (...).
"I'm Sam Rothstein," I said.

"I can change her."

NICKY: It was typical Ace.

He invited the biggest people in town,

and he knew they'd show.

Because he knew they all
wanted something from him.

With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride,

even Ginger.

With her, he still covered his bets.

They had to have the baby first
before they could get married.

He even made Jenny and me watch Amy

for a few days when they
went on their honeymoon.

But I didn't mind. We loved the kid.

(cheers and applause)

LESTER: Can you feel my eyes on you?

Can you feel me look into your heart?

Can you feel me in
the pit of your stomach?

Can you feel me in you?

In your heart?

Don't make me come there.

Answer me.

GINGER (crying): I love you.

But, baby, do you know that I love you too?

GINGER: No, Lester.

Do you know that?

Yeah.

This is the best thing
I can do for my life right now.

That's right.

So it's gonna be okay, isn't it?

Promise?

God, I wish you

all the luck in the world.

You do?

Yeah, I do.

I mean, it's-it's the best thing
you can do right now.

I mean this.

Now you'll have real security.

Sweetheart...

you're gonna be situated
just right in Vegas.

Come on, this is great for us.

I'm always gonna be here for you.

I ain't going no place.

Huh?

I'm looking at you right now.

I'm seeing you for the very
first time right this minute.

I'm seeing you,
and I can feel my heart click.

I see you 14 years old.

I see the first second I ever saw you.

I see you, long-legged little colt,

with stupid braces on your teeth.

(sniffles) Okay, then.

Every time I ever see you,
that's what I see.

Um, talk to you later.

Bye.

You all right?

Yeah.

Why are you crying?

(chuckles)

I'm not crying.

Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.

I'm okay. I just...

You just have to understand.

I've been with Lester since I was a kid.

I just wanted to say goodbye.

I-I just... I don't...

I think I have a right to do that.

Okay?

It's all right.

That part of your life is over with.

Right?

Yeah.

You're with me now.

(inhales sharply) Yeah.

Want to go?

Let's go back in.

Okay.

Oh...

(chuckles): It's great.

(giggles) It's great.

(squeals) It's all my stuff.

Oh, my God.

You brought all my stuff.

I can't...

Try it on. It's yours.

You're kidding.

My God. What is it?

It's chinchilla.

Oh, it's so soft.

Nice, isn't it?

Do I keep my promises

So wonderful.

The jewelry's not so bad either.

The only thing is

you shouldn't keep this in the house.

We got to put it in the bank.

Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?

No. Pay attention to me.

What I'm gonna tell you is very important.

Okay.

All this stuff doesn't mean anything.

Money, this, doesn't mean

ACE: With over a million
in cash and jewels

tucked in a bank in Vegas
only for Ginger,

she was secure and happy.

She loved that (...).

But a guy in my line of work

has to have a lot of payoff cash around.

Crooked cops and kidnappers,
they don't take checks.

Need a little help with that, Mr. Collins?

So I put $2 million in cash
in Los Angeles bank

under the name of Mr.
and Mrs. Tom Collins.

This was strictly my shakedown
and kidnapping money.

(Ginger grunts, laughing)

And since I'd either be in jail

or locked in a closet when
I needed the money the most,

I gave Ginger the only key

to the cash that could get me back alive.

And this is just a signature card.

So once she signs those papers,

she'll be the only person to
have total access to the box.

No one else, including myself.

That's right.

That's the way you wanted it, right?

Sam, let me ask you a question.

You must really trust your wife.

Yeah. Sure, I do. Why?

No, that-that-- that's good

It's just unusual.

Tell you the truth,
so many of my clients don't.

Okay.

♪ Never will I know happiness ♪

ACE: With Ginger and the money
in place, I felt covered.

And to play it safe,

I switched job titles again
and made myself, um,

Food and Beverage Director.

This way nobody would
bother me about a license.

I mean, Vegas was like a dream for me.

Trouble was,

Nicky was dreaming his own kind of Vegas.

NICKY: To begin I put money
out on the street

chargin' three points a week.

You know, juice to the (...)in' dealers.

Don't make us come looking for you.

No, you won't have to look for me.

I appreciate it. Thanks, Nicky.

And they were degenerate
gamblers, coke freaks.

In no time I had half
the dealers and the Tangiers

in my pocket.

Then, the next thing I did,

I started bustin' out
high-stakes poker players.

ACE: It was so obvious.

I mean, all of Nicky's
half-(...)ed mechanics,

they were real signal-happy.

I'm gonna open for $500.

Signaling back and forth...

PLAYER: I've been losing
for three days straight nonstop.

PLAYER 2: Come on, why you cryin' with two
loaves of bread under your arm?

Nicky thought nobody was watching him.

But he was wrong.

And I didn't want any
of those agents near my place.

Four aces, Doc. What do...

Christ, I can't believe it.

DOC: If I didn't have bad luck,
I wouldn't have any luck.

I'm out of here, you understand?

ACE: I mean, I wished to God

Nicky and his whole crew
would just get lost.

But what am I gonna do,
go back home and start a war?

I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not.

I can't do that.

Be careful. Gaming agents
are all over the place.

So I'm lucky. I'm not allowed
to get lucky in this place?

You've been lucky all week.
They're looking to nail you.

NICKY: Ace was so (...)in'
worried about his casino

he forgot what we were doing
out here in the first place.

A million times I wanted
to yell in his (...)in' ear,

"This is Las Vegas.

"We're supposed to be out here robbin',
you dumb (...)in' hebe."

I don't give a (...) who he's connected to.

Tell him to take
his (...)in' feet off the table.

What's he think this is,

Sir, would you mind taking
your feet off the table

Yeah, I would mind. I'm havin' a bad night.

(...)in' (...)hole won't budge.

Call security.

How are you?

Good. How are you?

Good. You want to do me a favor?
You want to take your feet

off the table and put your shoes back on?

(...) you.

I want you to exit this guy off the premises,

and I want you to exit him

ACE: Sure enough,
an hour later, I get the call.

Ace, what happened over there?

I mean, did you know that guy
you threw out was with me?

No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?

No.

He insulted Billy, then I walked
over to him politely,

and he tells me to go (...) myself.

Then he called me a (...).

So what do you think I did? I threw that (...) out.

What? H-hold on. Hey, come here.

You called my friend a (...)?
You tell him to go (...) himself?

Nicky, I didn't...

Is that what you did?
Tell him to go (...) himself?

I didn't know he was your...

(grunting continues)

Come here. Get him up. Come here.

Come here, come here.
You go over there right now

You better hope he lets you back in.

If you ever get out of line
over there again,

I'll smash your (...)in' head so hard

you won't be able to get

You (...)in' hick.

Sammy, listen.

This guy obviously doesn't know
who he was talking to, you understand?

He doesn't know that, uh,
we're dear friends.

I mean, he's already very sorry.

But, uh, if you could do me
a favor and let him back in,

I swear to you he'll never
get out of line again.

I promise you that.

If he does it again, he's out for good.

I don't care what it is, Nick. I'm gonna--

I'll-I'll never let him in the place again.

I'm sorry about this, really.

NICKY: You know, Ace could be
a very touchy guy,

especially when he got
bigger and bigger in town.

Like when they hired
that Johnathon and David

and their tigers away from the palace

by building them a new stage

and then giving them
a silver Rolls-Royce.

But I'll tell you, he knew how
to bring in the crowds.

Knew all the (...)in' angles.

He brought over the whole
Femme Fatale show from Paris.

But he forgot how lazy

them European dancin' broads could get.

I mean, he had to
weigh them in once a week

to make sure they didn't
blow up like (...)in' balloons.

ACE: She's still

eight pounds over.
What's the reason for this?

(sighs) Mr. Rothstein, sir,

let me put her on suspension.

Never mind the "sir." Never mind the "sir."

Well, sorry. I was just trying

to offer you the respect
that your position...

Why is she eight pounds over?

Mr. Rothstein is good enough for you.

Mr. Rothstein.

Well, sometimes when you
put that pressure point...

She needs to lose a half a pound.

When you put that pressure point
on them, you know, it shows...

Listen, all you do is give me answers.

Just-just give me the right answer.

But, sir, I don't know why.

I guess maybe because she's frightened

that if she doesn't lose the
weight, she may even get fired.

That's right, she will get fired.

In fact, I want you to
send her back to Paris.

It's always been our policy...

Just stop everything.

This woman's an institution.

I don't care what she is. She's an institution,
that's the problem-- she's lazy.

NICKY: Hey, I gotta give the guy credit.

I mean, he does the most obvious thing.

This is the only town in the country

where a bookie joint is legit.

So why not take advantage, right?

So he took bookie joints off the street

and then opened them up
inside the casino.

Well, within a few years,
by doing all of this,

he had every casino on the strip

trying to copy off of him.

But as much as they loved her...

Oh! Fabulous.

Loose machines are right back over there.

What are they doing way back there?

Bring them up here where they belong.

You can't even see them over there.

Okay. I'll...

What about the progressives with
the high jackpots? Where are they?

These machines are hidden.

These are our best machines. They bring all the action.

No wonder the drop is off.

Yeah, okay.

not in the back. Bring 'em up front.

ACE: Well, it wasn't long

before what I was afraid
was gonna happen happened.

Nicky managed to get himself banned

from every casino in Las Vegas.

And from then on I couldn't
be seen talking to him

NICKY: What the (...)

and unsavory reputation--" Mother(...)er.

Unsavory (...)in'...

Is there any way around this?

Nope, there's no way.

Let's say, for instance,

I want to go in the restaurant,

which happens to be in the casino,

to get one of those sandwiches I like.

Forget it.

You can't even set foot in the parking lot.

That's how serious it is.

In other words I'm (...)ed.

In so many words, yes.

ACE: It just didn't sink into his head

about the Black Book and what it meant.

Not being able to go into
a casino is just one thing,

but being in this book etched
your name into the brains

of every cop and FBI agent in the state.

I mean, you're listed in there
with Al Capone.

But Nicky didn't care.

I gotta do somethin'.
I gotta do somethin'.

They ain't gettin' rid of me.

They're not gettin' rid of me.
I'm stayin' here.

(...) 'em.

(...) 'em.

NICKY: So, once they pulled that (...),

I started doing my own things in Vegas

nobody ever thought of doing.

To keep an eye on things,

I brought in my kid brother Dominick

and some desperadoes from back home

and started knockin' over high rollers,

casino bosses, bookmakers--
anybody right here in town.

I had a good (...)in' crew going
for me, I'll tell you that.

I had Sal Fusco,
a great second-story guy.

Jack Hardy.

He worked for a safe company
before he did a six-year bit.

And then there was Bernie Blue.

This guy can bypass any alarm for me.

It was like old times.

And I opened up my own jewelry
store, too, the Gold Rush.

Sometimes I used to go along on
a heist just for the fun of it.

But I didn't like the people
I was rippin' off looking at me,

so I used to turn
their (...)in' pictures around.

What's taking so long over there?

This peter's a mother(...)er.

It's working. Just keep working it.

NICKY: You gotta learn how
to open these (...)in' things

so you don't have to take 'em.

Frankie, some of these stones
got a lot of (...)s in 'em.

Tell that (...)in' Pepe
if he's switching stones on us,

he better take a (...)in' camel back to...

(phone rings)

Yeah.

Listen, they're in Penthouse K.

They check in alone?

They checked in alone.

Are they out now?

Yes. Don't worry.

All right. Thanks.

ACE: He had tipsters
all over town. Bellmen.

Valet parkers.

They're just checking in now.

Okay, I'll tell him.

Pit bosses. Secretaries.

It's all in mint-condition coins.

Mint condition. All right.

And they all got a piece of the score.

Car's coming.

♪ Can't you hear me knocking? ♪

♪ Yeah, down the gaslight street now ♪

They were very careful.

They always bypassed the alarms,

or else, if not, they'd drill enough holes

to knock through the walls
with a sledgehammer.

Nicky was grabbing everything he could.

Nobody out there was
expecting a guy like him.

To Nicky, Las Vegas was
the (...)in' Wild West.

I just got a shipment of diamonds from Israel.

NICKY: Well, what the (...)
they expect from me?

I had to earn, didn't I?

You know, this diamond has flaws in it.

No, no, there's no flaws in it.

MAN 2: Don't tell me.

I'm doing this for 25 years.

You better clean your (...)in' loupe,

'cause there's no flaws in these diamonds.

NICKY: Whenever we got local merch,

we'd usually send it
to Palm Springs or Arizona, LA.

I had a couple of sand (...)s
out there. You know, Arabs.

What, are you gonna have
a (...)ing meeting here,
or you gonna buy some diamonds?

I know his language. I'm talking with him.

$40,000, you buy the whole package.

$20,000. That's my final offer, and...

All of a sudden he talks English now.

Let's talk turkey here. How about $25,000?

NICKY: I actually turned
my bedroom into a bank vault

where I kept the choice stuff.

I couldn't leave it at the Gold Rush

in case we got raided by the cops,

or if my crew got cute.

I had the only key.
Jennifer didn't give a (...).

She used to fall asleep on the couch

watching television every night.

This stuff was all mine.

I didn't send any of this back home.

Actually, I couldn't,
because I wasn't even

supposed to be doin' it.

The bosses were making so much
(...)in' money with the casinos

that they didn't want anybody
makin' any waves for them.

Gave all the guys
in your crew a piece of that?

I took care of everybody.

Yeah?

That's why there was no real
organized street stuff in Vegas

before I came here.

Yeah, that works out.

But how much cash could
I bury in my closet, right?

You have to understand,
and I'm sure you do,

that in a venture of this kind,

you have to be prepared
to take some kind of loss.

So I put some of the money
into legitimate deals

with Charlie Clark.

He was Ace's banker.

I mean, you will try to push it
through, won't you, Mr. Clark?

Yes.

Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you $50,000 cash.

Then I put some more

of the money in some legitimate
places, like my restaurant.

MAN: Is that the last one?

MAN 2: Yeah.

I had my kid brother, Dominick,
run it for me.

(spits)

(...)ers.

Here you go, guys.

All right. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

Yeah. Enjoy. Have a good time.

Choke on it, mother(...)er.

Hey, Dom.

Hey. How you doin'?

ACE: Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants.

He was a real restaurant buff.

And over the years,
he always made money with them.

In Vegas, he had the Leaning Tower.

It was a very popular spot.

He had politicians,
showgirls, and movie stars

hanging out all over the place.

Listen, that show over at the
Flamingo gets better and better.

By the way, Sammy said,
whenever you have a minute,

give him a call.

Made a messenger out of you too, huh?

I'll do anything for a buck.

He does it to everybody.

Enjoy your dinner.

Thanks.

But I got to tell you,
the thing Nicky liked most

was the showgirls naturally.

I mean, to them Nicky was the movie star.

You walk past me?

Hey.

This is Shelly.

How are you? Nice to meet you.

And this is Stacey.

Stacey, this is Nick.

We're gonna have dinner. Come on.

All right. Uh,
let's check the kitchen first.

Excuse us one second.
Come on, I'll show you.

NICKY: 'Cause I fly
stuff in fresh every day.

I get bread from back home.
I get fish from California.

And you can always tell
a great kitchen like ours

because of the milk-fed veal.

That's the secret.

See, milk-fed veal is pure white.

Out here, they got that pink veal.

Slide over, honey.

Now, pink veal, you can
pound that (...) for two days.

It'll never ever get tinder,
you know what I mean?

I left here with the money.

NICKY: Oh.

Got muscled on the street.

A couple of guys, I owe them.

Yeah.

So that's what I did.
I gave them the money.

That's what I did.

Uh-huh. Yeah?

Yeah.

You call yourself a man?

You know you're a lyin' low-life,

mother(...)in' gamblin' degenerate prick?

You know that's what you are?
Two small kids at home.

I gave you money to pay the (...)in' rent

and buy groceries, put the heat on.

You know your wife called Frankie

and told him the (...)in' heat's off? Huh?

And you didn't gamble that (...)in' money?

You're gonna stand here and tell me that?

No? No? You didn't?

I didn't.

Don't (...) with me, Al!
Don't make a (...) out of me.

You want to embarrass me
and make a fool out of me?

You didn't gamble?

Tell me you gambled the (...)in' money,

I'll give you the (...)in' money
to put the (...)in' heat on!

Did you gamble? Huh?

(...)in' degenerate, you.

(...)in' kids at home.

Here. Get the (...) out of here.

Thanks, Nick.

Yeah, thanks.

Let me find out you (...)ed up,

I'll leave you wherever I find you.

How many of these you gonna eat, huh?

Two.

Two?

ACE: But around 6:30 in the morning,
when he finished his day,

no matter where he was
or what he was doing,

he always went home to make breakfast

for his son, Nicky Boy.

A little butter, right? Not a lot.

Mm-hmm.

You know why, right?

Yeah.

Why?

'Cause it clogs up your heart.

What a smart kid you are.

Mwah! Okay, eat.

NICKY: Every couple of weeks I used to
send Marino back to the bosses

with a piece of what I made.

Not a big piece, but (...) them,
what did they know?

They were 1,500 miles away,

and I don't know anybody
who can see that far.

Their drop was a truck stop garage

where Remo and the guys used to
hang out and count their millions.

FRANK: Remo.

Hey, Frankie.

NICKY: I mean, the cops knew,
but they didn't give a (...).

I mean, you know, they all
worked it out together.

Nicky sends his warmest regards.

But I knew how to keep the bosses happy.

Whenever they gave me little jobs to do,

you know, to send a message,
I would carry things out

to... a... T.

Like the time Tony Dogs,

who's supposed to be the new
maniac tough guy in town,

shot up one of Remo's bars.

Here's a (...)ing guy
kills two of Remo's guys

and a poor (...)in' waitress
who was just working

on her night off, of all things.

I mean, this guy is just
beggin' to be made

an example of.

REMO: Frankie...

I want all the names of all the
other people he had with him,

and I don't care what you have
to do to him to get them.

You understand?

I'll take care of it, Remo.

(speaks Italian)

To be truthful with you, I had
to admire this (...)in' guy.

He was one of the toughest
Irishmen I ever met.

This son of a (...) was tough.

For two days and two (...)in' nights,

we beat the (...) out of this guy.

I mean, we even
stuck ice picks in his balls.

You better home he gives me
a (...)in' name soon,

or I'm gonna give him yours, Frank.

Yeah. Thanks a lot.

But he never talked.

In the end I had to put
his (...)in' head in a vice.

Dogs... Dogs, can you hear me, Dogs?

Listen to me, Anthony.

I got your head in a (...)in' vice.

I'll squash your (...)in'
head like a grapefruit

if you don't give me a name.

Don't make me have to do this.
Please. Come on.

Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.

(...) you.

This mother(...)er. You believe this?
Two (...)in' days and nights.

(...) me?

(...) me? You mother(...)er!

(...) my mother?
That's what you (...)in' tell me?

(skull crunching)

Huh? You mother(...)er, you! Huh?

Oh, God.

(gurgles)

NICKY: Give me the (...)in' name!

(grunting): Ch-Charlie M.

Charlie M.?

Charlie M.

Charlie M.? You make me pop your
(...)in' eye out of your head

to protect that piece of (...)?!

Charlie M.?! You dumb mother(...)er!

Kill me, you (...). Kill me.

Kill you? You mother(...)er, you!

(grunting, gurgling)

Frankie! Do him a (...)in' favor.

ACE: The word got around

that finally,

there was a real gangster in town.

Nicky was the new boss of Las Vegas.

(gurgles)

NICKY: Charlie M.

(bells ringing)

ACE: Four reels, sevens,
across three $15,000 jackpots?

Do you have any idea what the odds are?

Shoot, it's gotta be in
the millions. Maybe more.

Three (...)ing jackpots in 20 minutes?

Why didn't you pull the machines?

Why didn't you call me?

Well, it happened so quick.

Three guys won. I didn't
have a chance to call you.

You didn't see the scam? You didn't see
what was going on?

Well, there's no way
to determine that, Sam.

Yes, there is--
an infallible way! They won.

Well, it's a casino. People
gotta win sometimes.

Hey, Ward, you're pissing me off.

Now you're insulting my intelligence.

What do you think, I'm a (...)ing idiot?

You know god(...) well somebody
had to get into those machines
and set those (...)ing reels.

The probability on one four-reel machine
is a million and a half to one.

On three machines in a row,
it's in the billions.

It cannot happen-- would not happen!

You (...)ing momo!
What's the matter with you?

Didn't you see you were
being set up on the second win?

I really think you're...

You-- Wait. You didn't see that
you were being set up on the second win?

I really think you're
overreacting to this whole...

Listen, you (...)in' yokel,
I've had it with you.

I've been carrying your (...)
in this place ever since I got here.

Get your (...) and get your things
and get out of here.

You're firin' me?

I'm firing you.

No, I'm not firin'-- I'm firing you.

You might regret this.

I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.

This is not the way to treat people.

Listen, if you didn't know you
were being scammed, you're too
(...)ing dumb to keep this job.

If you did know, you were in on it.
Either way, you're out!

Get out! Go on. Let's go.

The guy is history, as far
as I'm concerned. History.

But you can't just fire him.
Webb's his brother-in-law.

He's county commissioner.

So what?

Everybody out here with
cowboy boots is a (...)ing
county commissioner

or related to a county commissioner.

I'm (...)ing sick of it.

This is his state. His uncle's chief judge.

His brother-in-law runs
the county commission.

I don't know how many other
relatives he's got in this town.

There's gotta be a way
to work him back in.

Phil, I understand.

You're in the finances. You're upstairs.

But you are not on the floor.
You don't see what's going on.

I've got thousands of players.
I've got 500 dealers.

They're all looking
to rob me blind 24 hours a day.

I have to let them know
I'm watching all the details

all the time, that there
is not one single thing

I will not catch as I am over here.

Look at yours.

What?

Look at that.

Look at... look at this. There's nothing.

Look at how many blueberries
your muffin has and how many mine has.

Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.

What are you talking about?

It's like everything else
in this place-- you don't do
it yourself, it never gets done.

Where you going?

♪ How long can this go on? ♪

From now on I want you to put
an equal amount of blueberries
in each muffin.

An equal amount
of blueberries in each muffin.

Do you know how long that's going to take?

I don't care how long it takes.

Put an equal amount in each muffin.

Come on, honey, just a little.

Attagirl. Attagirl. Oh, boy, look.

You want to go to Mommy?

Hi there. You want to come to Mommy?

It's all right, sweetheart.

I need to talk to you.

I need some money.

What do you need?

You got her? Okay.

Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.

Well, why don't you take
it out of your account?

There's a lot there.

Well, I would, you know, Sam.

It's just that...

well, I need more than that.
I need $25,000.

$25,000?

For yourself?

Yeah.

Why do you need that much?

Well, what's the difference?
I just need it.

Well, I mean, you know, I got to
ask you. That's a lot of money.

You're not asking for a box
of popcorn. You know, I mean...

I'm aware of that. We don't have
to turn this into a big deal.

Okay? We don't have to fight.

It was important to me. Forget it.

It was just something
I wanted to do for myself.

Who's fighting? I mean, I'm...

You know, tell me what it's for.

Why can't you tell me what it's for?

Huh?

Well, you know what?
Now I want you to tell me.

I mean, my wife comes to me
and asks me for $25,000.

I mean, what do you want?
Do you want a coat?

No.

Well, if you want a coat,
you got it. You know that.

It's not the money. It's just...
why do you want it?

That's all I'm asking.
Am I not entitled to ask that?

Sam, I've been independent my whole life.

I never had to ask anybody for anything.

Now you're making me beg you for this.

What are you talking about?

And you're embarrassing me.

Why do you want to make me feel so bad?

You're asking me for $25,000.

I'm not out to make you feel bad.

I want to just be able to trust you.

You know, it's about trust.

I have to be able to trust you
with my life. Do you understand?

Can I trust you?

Can I trust you?

Can I trust you?

Answer me. Can I trust you?

You can trust me.

Good. So then you can tell me
what the money is for.

Oh, no, he didn't want

So why did he have to do that, huh?

Tell me.

I know it wasn't a nice thing to do, but...

Yeah, no (...).

Well, you got to understand it.

You know, he doesn't know
if this guy is shaking you down

or taking advantage of you.

No. No.

I told him all about this guy
before we ever got married.

This is no (...)in' surprise.

Oh, you did? I didn't know that.

Yeah.

He's just a friend of mine
I was trying to help. So what?

You know, the first time I ever
saw you guys together,

I never saw him so happy.

I mean, I know he's a crazy
Jew (...) and everything, but...

I'd never seen... you know, he--
I'd never seen him act like that

with anybody else.

I think he's crazy about you.
I mean, he really loves you.

He does.

Oh, come on.

I went into this with my eyes open, you know.

I knew the bottom
could drop out at any time.

I'm a working girl, right?

You don't think I'm going
to go into a situation like this

if I don't think I'm going
to get covered on the back end.

Sure.

Am I right?

I could see that. Sure.

So he put aside some jewelry
for me. A lot of jewelry.

You mean like a lot of expensive
jewelry? About how much?

You want to steal it?

No. I'm-I'm just curious.

You know, I was wondering

how much he would put into
a thing like that. That's all.

I'm told it's worth about
a million dollars, maybe more.

Well, there you go.
What does that tell you?

A million dollars in jewelry.

Does that tell you the guy
is crazy about you or what?

I should have never married him.

He's a Gemini.

A triple Gemini. Duality.

Gemini's the snake. You know,
you can't trust a snake.

(sniffles) I mean it.

I know what you mean. Listen, Ginger.

You know, this is probably not...

And this is probably not what

I understand that. But...

Go slow, you know, see what happens.

He could have killed him.

Okay? He could have killed him.

He didn't have to hit him.

It's not even like

Mr. Rothstein, County Commissioner
Pat Webb is here to see you.

Okay. Give me a minute.

Okay. He'll be just a minute.

Mr. Webb, can I get you anything?

Uh, no. No, thank you, little lady.

Okay. Send him in
and call me four minutes after.

Mr. Rothstein. I'm Pat Webb.

How do you do?

Hey, it is a pleasure.

I heard a lot about you.

Oh, thank you, sir. Hey, house is doin' well.

(chuckles): Hey,
all that money is rollin' in.

I appreciate you takin' the time
to see a poor ol' civil servant.

No, that's quite all right.

Why don't you have a seat?

Hm? Oh, thank you, sir.

Uh, I come here personally
to kind of smooth over

any fracas about a certain matter.

See, uh, maybe you didn't know it, but, uh,

Don Ward is a very
well-liked man in this town.

He's got lots of friends here.

Nice family, and their money
go back many, many years.

Now, friends vote. Family and money votes.

That's important to me. And you.

And if you'll think about

our little problem along them lines--

and you'll forgive me for sayin' it--

maybe he did not deserve to be fired.

I'm sorry, but he knew about

our getting hit on three
big machines in a row,

and he did nothing about it.
That means either

he was in on it or--
forgive me for saying this--

he was too dumb to see what was going on.

Either way, I cannot have
a man like that working here.

Before we point the dirty end
of the stick at old Don, uh,

we better be sure
we can prove them charges.

Believe me, if I could prove it,
he would be under arrest.

Are, uh... (clears throat)

Are we certain that you want
the Gaming Control Board

eyeballing your record
and your gangster pals

like Nicky Santoro?

I think you're way out of line
talking to me like that.

What you're saying is libelous,

and you're in no position
to challenge my expertise.

I went way out of

my way to be very helpful
and courteous to that kid.

He's weak, he's incompetent,
he jeopardizes the whole place.

There's not much more I can do for him.

(chuckles) You have got me there.

Old Don is as useless as (...)s on a boar.

(coughs) But he is my brother-in-law,

and I would look on it as a personal favor

if you'd think some more
on hiring him back.

I can't do that.

And I appreciate the fact
that he's your brother-in-law,

and I do want to help you,
and I like to do favors.

And I know who you are.
But I cannot do that.

Well, could there be any position

farther down the trough?

I'm sorry. I can't do anything.

He's too incompetent,
and the bottom line is,

he cannot be trusted.

(phone ringing)

(into telephone): Okay. Thanks. Bye.

Well, you know, that's it. I'm sorry.

(sighs) Mr. Rothstein,

your people never will understand

the way it works out here.

You're all just our guests.

But you act like you at home.

Let me tell you somethin', partner.

You ain't home.

But that's where we're gonna send you

if it harelips the governor.

Thank you for your time.

No problem.

Sorry.

You bet.

What happened to my pills?

GINGER: Huh?

Isn't it bad enough you're drinking too much?
You're taking all my pills too?

I didn't take your pills.

Look, for my ulcer,
I take a half a one of these.

A half of one of these. And
that's when I have extreme pain.

I had a three-month supply.
What did you do with them?

(sniffles, crying): You didn't have to beat him up.

What?

I was just trying to help him.

Not like I'm sleeping with the guy.

Yeah, how do I know?

You can't make me stop caring about...

What? What?

I said...

you can't make me stop caring about people.

(crying continues)

Listen.

Ginger.

I'm trying to make the best
of everything here, you know?

I mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes.

I mean...

people look up to you in
this town. I don't know what

to do.

You know what, Ace?

I don't give a (...).

I'm getting out of here.

(sobbing): I am.

All right, look.

You got to get hold of yourself.

Okay.

If not for me, at least for Amy.

Okay. Okay.

You understand? Your drinking's
getting way out of hand.

I'm gonna get you into a program.

They got plenty of good ones.

I don't need one.

Yes, you do. It's very discreet.
There's no names in the papers.

You don't have to worry
about any of that stuff.

That's all you care about.

You don't care about me at all.

Yes, I... yes, I do.

No, you don't.

How could you say that?

You're a beautiful woman.
You're destroying yourself.

You don't need that stuff,

and you don't need that
(...)ing leech living off you.

I know you better than you know yourself.

You're a tiger. You're stronger than I am.

And when you set your
mind on doing something,

you do it better than anybody.

(sobbing shakily)

You're gonna do it.

You'll do it.

Oh, God. Oh, God.

Okay.

I'll try. I'll try.

I will.

Don't be mad at me, okay?

I will.

(sobs)

NICKY: No matter what the problems
were outside the count room,

it was all worth it.

The cash kept rollin' in...

and the suitcases kept comin' and goin'.

And let me tell you,

the (...)in' bottom line here is... cash.

The only problem was that after a while,

the bosses noticed that the suitcases

were getting a little light.

Aspett', wait a minute.

You mean to tell me that
the money we're robbing is being robbed?

That somebody's robbing from us?

We went through all this (...)in' trouble,

and somebody's robbing us?

NANCE: Well, like I said,

you know, it-it's part of the business.

It-it's considered leakage.

Leakage, my balls. I want
the guy who's robbing us.

NICKY: Even John Nance. That's
the guy who ran the skim.

He knew there wasn't much
you could do about it,

You got to know that a guy
who helps you steal--

even if you take care of him real well--

I mean, he's gonna steal
a little bit extra for himself.

Makes sense, don't it? Right?

Well, you go try and make these
hardheaded old greaseballs

understand that.

What's the point of skimming
if we're being skimmed?

Defeats the whole purpose
of what we're doing out there.

You know, they take this money
because they're my guys.

So you got to give them some leeway.

NICKY: But the bosses
never believed in leeway,

so listen to what they do.

They put Artie Piscano,
the underboss of KC,

in charge of making sure
nobody skimmed the skim.

What the hell have you been doing out there?

I was out there with my goomat.

Your goomat? What are
you doing with your goomat?

What else? I gave her a schiaff'.

NICKY: The only trouble was,
Piscano was a disaster.

This guy could (...) up a cup of coffee.

What the hell have you
been doing out there, Artie?

I'm out there more than I'm here.

And little did anybody know
where this would all lead.

If they did, they would have been
better off making (...)in' novenas.

You got to go back there
and talk to that guy.

Come on. Go back?

I never got paid my expenses for the last trip.

What expenses?

Well, I'm going all over laying money

out of my own pocket, and I
never get anything back.

What the hell's going on?

You got to go back out there.

Well, then from now on I'm
gonna start keeping records.

Artie... no records, Artie.

What are you gonna do
with records? Pay taxes?

I can't keep buying out my own
(...)ing dough for these trips,

and nothing ever comes back.

I mean, what the hell's going
on? What are we doing over here?

You're going out to Las Vegas.
You're having a good time at my expense.

The (...)? I mean, after all...

ACE: No matter how many
novenas you could make,

nothing was gonna stop what
came up next with the casino.

I can't believe you're doing this.

WOMAN: We made a deal.

You came to me, remember?

It turned out Phil Green, Mr. Integrity,

had a partner nobody knew about,

and when she showed up and
started demanding some money

from the Tangiers...

Why are you doing this to me?

Because you're wrong.

I'm not wrong.

Yes, you are.

No, I am not wrong.

...Green tried to stonewall her.

I will see to it that you
do not get away with this.

So she sued him in court.

The court will now hear the matter

of the plaintiff, Anna Scott,
against Tangiers Corporation

and its president, Phillip Green.

Good morning, Your Honor. John
Momet on behalf of Mr Green.

Mitchell Logan on behalf
of Anna Scott, Your Honor.

JUDGE: Mr. Logan, you can proceed.

Thank you, Judge.

(gavel bangs)

I believe he was absolutely fair,

and I'm delighted with the decision.

We got a problem. It didn't go too well.

Green has to open up the books,

has to show how he got the financing.

And hey, that's-that's not good.

NICKY: She was doin'
pretty good with her lawsuit.

But before she could start
countin' her money,

the boys back home decided

to settle the case out of court instead.

So they sent me.

(three gunshots)

MAN: Can you comment on
the murder of Anna Scott?

What are you talking about?

She was found last night,
shot in the head.

MAN 2: Is this just a
real estate partnership?

MAN 3: Her lawyer said you were partners.

We were...

we were involved in minor
real estate deals many years ago.

It was never a partnership.

(overlapping questions)

MAN 2: Did you ever hear
of the .42 Caliber Killer?

ACE: Now, instead of the cops
only looking at Nicky,

they started looking at Green too,

and he was supposed to be
our squeaky-clean front man,

so I had to start giving interviews

to make sure everybody knew the casino

was on the up and up.

So, actually, how often do you
really fill in for him?

Uh, Green's here
about two, three times a month,

and he's busy with
other real estate deals and...

and things. You know.

So in Green's absence,
then, you're the boss?

I serve at the pleasure
of the chairman of the board,

and my, uh, responsibilities

are to run the day-to-day operations.

So day-to-day, then, you're the boss.

Well, in a sense, you could say that...

I am the boss when Mr. Green is away.

You could say that.

WEBB: Huh. Have you read this?

Hmm? About Mr. Rothstein.

It says, "The Midwest bookmaker
"with mob ties

"says that he is the real boss of
the $100-million Tangiers casino empire."

You believe that?

Did he really say that?

Why, of course he really
said that. It's right here.

Has that man even filed
for his license yet?

I don't know. We have to check the files.

Well, without getting

your shorts in a knot,
would you... would you do that?

And kind of check closely.

'Cause we may have to kick
a kike's (...) out of town.

Thank you.

A Gaming Control Board
investigation of Tangiers executive
Sam Rothstein's application

for a gaming license
is underway. Rothstein,

who heads the Tangiers casino operation

and is a boyhood friend

of Las Vegas mob boss Nicky Santoro,

could lose his ability
to work in the casino...

(mutes TV)

(phone rings)

Hello?

Listen, I got to meet Clean Face
right away. What about the Chez Paris?

Uh, you... you can't.
You got to make a reservation.

It's all booked up.

No, no, it's okay.

It's impossible. It's booked up,

and you got to make a reservation.

It's very difficult to get in

No, it's okay.
I'll use the service entrance.

I'll see you at 9:00.

Uh... all right.

The battle between state gaming officials

and Tangiers casino boss Sam
"Ace" Rothstein is heating up.

Tonight, an up-to-the-minute look

at Ace Rothstein's attempt
to get state licensing

despite law enforcement allegations

of Rothstein's
organized-crime connections.

Will Sam Rothstein's friendship

with alleged organized-crime
figure Nicky Santoro

keep Rothstein from running
the Tangiers casino?

And can the integrity of state
gaming laws be jeopardized

by a boyhood friendship?

Why don't you take it easy
with that stuff? Huh?

Come on. Let me help you now. Come on.

We're talking about some stuff.

Tonight at 6:00: Will a boyhood friendship

unseat Rothstein
as the Tangiers casino boss?

Exclusive on the KVVO Special News Report.

Go downst-- Just... go downstairs.

(reporter continues indistinctly on TV)

You can't let this concern you, Ace.

Don't worry about that stuff.

It's just a political witch hunt.

Hey, Ace.

Want something to drink?

Charlie, you want a refill?

Yeah. A refill would be great.

No, I don't want nothing.
Hey, Mr. Clark. How you doing?

Hey. Good.

I've been trying to reach you.
You're tougher to get than the president.

Well, I've been busy.

Yeah. The least you could do is
return my phone calls, though.

Listen, Nicky, we talked about this.

And, uh, I explained to you
that there was the possibility

you might have to take some kind of loss.

Yeah.

I think I want my money back.

(chuckles): What are you gonna do,

strong-arm me? (chuckles)

You know...
I think that you got the
wrong impression about me.

I think, in all fairness,

I should explain to you
exactly what it is that I do.

For instance, tomorrow morning
I'll get up nice and early,

take a walk down over to the bank

and... walk in and see,

and, uh, if you don't have
my money for me,

I'll crack your (...)in' head wide open

in front of everybody in the bank.

And just about the time
that I'm coming out of jail,

hopefully, you'll be coming
out of your coma.

And guess what.

I'll split your (...)in' head open again.

'Cause I'm (...)in' stupid.

I don't give a (...) about jail.

That's my business. That's what I do.

And we know what you do,
don't we, Charlie?

You (...) people out of money
and get away with it.

You can't talk to me like that.

Hey, you fat Irish prick.

You put my (...)in' money to sleep.

You go get my money, or I'll put
your (...)in' brain to sleep.

(breathing heavily): Sam...

Never mind (...)in' Sam. This is personal.

I'll be there in the morning.
You can (...)in' try me, fatso.

You (...)in' try me.

You think he got the point?

What are you doing?

He's a square guy, for chrissakes.

You can't treat him like that.
He's gonna run to the FBI.

(...) the FBI. That prick's
been dodging me for three weeks.
What is it with you?

All of a sudden you're trying to
tell me what to do all the time.

I'm not trying to tell you what to do.

But you were way out of line, Nick.
What are you doing? Where's your head?

Where's my head?
Where's your (...)in' balls?

Huh? You know I'm trying

to put something
really big together out here?

You know what I'm talking about?
Huh? You know.

If you're acting like this now,
how can I depend on you?

There's a lot of things
gonna change out here,

and if you want
to be there with me, Sammy,

you're gonna have to go my (...)in' way.

Listen, Nick. You gotta understand my situation.

I'm responsible for thousands of people.

I got a hundred million a year
going through the place.

It's all over-- I'm gonna
tell you, it's all over

if I don't get that
license, and believe me,

if it goes bad for me,
it's gonna go bad for

a lot of people. You understand?

Yeah. Forget about your (...)in' license.

I plant my own flag out here,

you ain't gonna need a (...)in' license.

You know, I don't know what it is, Sammy,

but the more I talk to you,

the more I feel like you just
don't want to go along with me.

Is that it? You should say so.

No, I don't want to come--

I don't want to come along with
you. I'll be honest with you.

Just say so. All right. Fine.

I don't want to be involved in
anything you're talking about,

okay? I just want to run
a square joint. That's it.

I just want my license.

I want everything
nice and quiet. That's it.

You mean quiet like this?
"I'm the boss"? That's quiet?

That's all taken out of context.
I had no control over that.

Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll

tell you exactly what happened.

Well, back home they don't know
about (...)in' control. That looks bad.

Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.

Every time you're on television
I get mentioned.

That looks bad. That looks bad.

What the (...) happened to you?

Will you tell me?

What happened to me? What happened to you?
You lost your control.

I lost control?

Yes, you lost your control.

Look at you. You're (...)in'
walking around like John Barrymore.

A (...)in' pink robe and a (...)in'...

a-a-a cigarette holder?
I'm-- I lost control?

You know, I didn't want to bring this up,

but you've been treating a lot of people

with a lot of disrespect,
even your own wife.

My wife?

Yeah.

Now, what does she have
to do with all of this?

Well, she came to see me. She
was upset about a lot of things,

especially that whole (...)in' Diamond--

that Lester Diamond incident.

All of a sudden you're
the shoulder to cry on?

Did you at least tell her
about your little role in that

whole situation?

No, I didn't. What good would that do?

That's not the (...)in' point.

Listen, I would...

The point is that she's upset.

She's-- And you got a (...)in' problem.

I would appreciate it
if you stay out of my personal life, okay?

You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.

Please, don't do it to me. Okay?

She came to talk to me, and I--

what was I supposed to do? Throw her out?

Just stay away from her.

It's none of your business, okay?
There are certain things

you don't do, and you know that.

It's none of my business?

A week ago it was my business,
now it's none of my business.

In other words, when you need me
to take care of something
for you, then you need me.

Yeah, that's right, the way you
need me to vouch for you as a citizen

and get you out of one of your jams.

I'm gonna have to straighten out
what you just did with this guy.

This guy is gonna run to the FBI.

Your (...)in' head is getting
bigger than your casino.
That's your problem, pal.

ACE: I knew what he wanted, and
I didn't want any part of it.

Nicky wanted to take over.

He wanted to go after Gaggi,
go after the skim,

go after everything and everybody.

Plus, he had stopped asking
permission from back home

for every little thing.

(gunshot, the Rolling Stones'
"Gimme Shelter" playing)

A casino boss and his wife were killed.

The bulls questioned Nicky.

A dealer from the Sirocco.
They questioned Nicky.

A bunch of stool pigeons wound
up in the trunks of their cars.

They questioned Nicky.

A lawyer.

They questioned Nicky.

And when some guys who didn't
pay their shylocks

began disappearing,

Nicky's name was in
every one of those newspapers.

Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders,

but they always had to let him go.

There were never any witnesses.

NICKY: The coppers blamed me

for everything that went wrong out here,

and I mean every little
(...)in' thing too.

Watch yourself.
Don't get runned over, there.

If a guy (...)in' tripped
over a (...)in' banana peel,

they'd bring me in for it.

Come on, huh? That's enough.
Be nice, huh? Be nice.

And the bosses were no better.

I mean, they complained day and night

because things don't run smooth.

Well, in my line of work things
don't run so smooth. I'm sorry.

I mean, I'm dealing with
degenerate animals out here.

But the bosses--
what do they give a (...)?

They're sittin' on their (...)es
drinkin' anisette.

Meanwhile, I'm the guy in the trenches.

(...)in' bosses.

They think it's a (...)in'
free lunch out here.

Frankie...

they found a guy's head in a desert.

Do you know about that?

Yeah, I heard it. Yeah.

Yeah.

Everybody's talking about it.

They're making a big deal out of it.

I know.

It's in all the papers.

What are you gonna do?

And, I mean...

that's no good.

I know.

You got to tell them to take
care of things a little better.

I'll tell them, Remo.

NICKY: (...)in' bosses. I mean, they're
smokin' their Di Nobilis

and they're eatin' a trippa
and (...)in' soffritto--

you know, fried pigs' guts--

while if I want to talk private,

I got to go to a (...)in' bus stop.

But hey, what do they care?

As long as I keep sending money back.

Yeah, but they're complainin'.

Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.

I do all the work.

Somebody don't like it, (...) 'em.

It's up to you.

They want a (...)in' war, I'm ready.

I know one thing-- all I got
to do is take care of four or
five of those (...)in' guys.

The rest will fall
right into place, believe me.

Peekaboo, you (...)s, you.

I see you, you mother(...)ers.

ACE: The problem was Nicky was not
only bringing heat on himself

but on me too.

The FBI watched every move he made.

But he didn't care. He just didn't care.

NICKY: If you're gonna watch me,

(...) 'em, I'm gonna watch 'em right back.

I spent a few bucks.
Top dollar. Who gives a (...)?

I got the latest antibuggin' equipment

from the same places
that sell to the (...)in' CIA.

I had all the special
police frequency radios,

FBI descramblers, cameras that
see in the dark, and because of that,

the miserable sons of (...)es
that they are,

they never once caught me doin'
anything I couldn't handle.

ACE: I got my job

on the line, and this guy's out
having the time of his life.

He has every cop
in the state watching him,
and he's out playing golf.

And at the worst possible time for me.

I had my license hearing
coming up, and I didn't want
to leave anything to chance.

...19 years ago, and they
were simple gambling pinches.

I mean, if I can't work
in Vegas, where am I gonna go?

You've been very open with us.

I mean, uh, your books and papers.

That-that's gonna mean
something when you go
before the commission.

Well, that's all I ask,
gentlemen, is a fair hearing.

Okay, well, this kind
of honesty will guarantee
that fair hearing.

Good.

All right, well,

we'll move on to...

(airplane engine sputtering)

I wanted to hear something
about... Kansas City...

(sputtering continues)

What the (...) is this?

Where's this (...)in' guy
gonna land in, the fairway?

They're (...)in' agents, Frankie.
Look at this!

ACE: The feds were watching
Nicky play golf for so long

they ran out of gas.

Just what I needed. Right
in front of the Control Board.

Hundred dollars, whoever hits the plane.

ACE: And as if things
weren't bad enough,

in comes Piscano,
the Kansas City underboss.

He ran that little grocery store

in Kansas City where
they brought the suitcases.

They're fightin' over
those suitcases again.

You know what that means, right?
You know what that means, right?

That means I gotta take
another trip out to Vegas,

and it's gonna cost me
another couple of grand.

He ran it with his brother-
in-law, but mostly what he did

was complain-- complain
about his trips to Vegas

to his brother-in-law and
to his mother, all the time.

MAN: You gotta lay down the law.

Otherwise, they're gonna
make a fool out of you.

Can't make a fool out of me. I
write it all down in this book,

every (...)in' nickel
that goes down, right here.

Hey! Oh! Wah!

What's the matter with you?

Receipts-- I'm sorry.

Since when do you talk like that?

I'm sorry.

There's a lot of people here.

Nance gives me trouble,
and I'll tell him screw around

with those suitcases,
and I'll take the eyes

out of his freakin' head.

Again.

I didn't curse. I said "freakin' head."

That's enough!

I'm sorry.

And what happens next?
You can't believe it.

I mean, who the hell
would believe that the FBI

had a wire in the place
looking for some information

about some old homicide about
some guy who was whacked out

God knows when over God knows what?

What's to prevent him with the suitcases

that he can take what he wants?

(...)in' Nance, he brings us back
two suitcases from the Tangiers,

and what about three? Or four?

We've got nobody in the room

to watch-- that's the law.
You know we can't even

go into the count room to watch our money?

Could you believe this cowboy bull(...)?

And sure, he's got his people in there.

But how do you know?

They could all be in on it
together, those miserable (...)s.

I'll find out. And if it's Green himself,

I'll bury that (...).

I never trusted him.
And, you know, I got eyes

behind my head. They trust
that (...)bag, I don't.

Right now, the way I feel,

I'll hit the two of them in
the head with a (...)in' shovel.

All right, take it easy now.

Take it easy.

Ma, I'm sorry. They're
beatin' me left and right.

Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.

I know, but that's enough.

You know-- you know what

they're doing to me.
I can't take this no more.

I know it. I know it.

Back and forth, back and forth.

Take it easy, though.

All right. All right.

You could get a heart attack like that.

I'm too upset right now.

An end has to be put to this.

And the (...) thing is,
they go and hear all this stuff

about Las Vegas and the casinos
and suitcases... and that's it.

PISCANO: If I have to start
handling things the way

I did years ago and start
kickin' (...), I'll-I'll do it.

And I'll use the god(...) shovel.

PISCANO'S MOTHER: You are right.

PISCANO: Everything's comin'
out of my pocket.

I gotta pay for all these trips
back and forth, back and forth.

You are right. What can I tell you?

ACE: Would you believe
that such a thing could happen?

PISCANO: I'm in this to make money,
not to lose money.

ACE: Every FBI man across the country

had their ears open now.

PISCANO: Because if you
want something done right,
you gotta do it yourself.

MOTHER: Then do it the way
you want. What can I tell you?

ACE: I mean, Piscano, this guy
basically sunk the whole world.

MOTHER: That's the way people are.

There are some that are good
and some that are bad.

MAN: Mr. Chairman, members
of the commission,

Mr. Rothstein is pleased to be here today.

And when the day finally came,
I was ready.

I felt so confident that all I had to do

was present my case.

...and we have documents, one of which

is a report by retired
FBI agents, which completely

absolves Mr. Rothstein
from any wrongdoing.

I'd like this marked, Mr. Chairman.

HARRISON: Pardon me. Counselor,

before you continue--

No, I want to have this marked, Mr.--

This, uh, this commission

is prepared to act on a motion

denying the Rothstein application.

Denying?

Do I hear a motion seconded?

LAWYER: Mr. Chairman...

MAN: Mr. Chairman, I second the motion.

Do I have a vote on the motion?

Mr. Chairman!

Aye.

Aye.

Aye.

The ayes have it.
This hearing is adjourned.

You guys have to be kidding. "Adjourned"?

What do you mean, "adjourned"?

Mr. Chairman, please.

ACE: Mr. Chairman, Senator,
you promised me a hearing.
You won't allow me a hearing?

You didn't even look at the FBI reports.

When you were my guest,
Mr. Chairman, Senator,

at the Tangiers hotel,
did you not promise me

that I would have a fair hearing?

I was never your guest at the Tangiers.

You were never my guest?
I never comped you?

That's right.

I don't comp you at least
two or three times a month

at the Tangiers?

I'd like to answer that at this time.

Mr. Rothstein is being
very typical to this point.

He's lying. The only time
I was at the Tangiers

was when I had dinner
with Barney Greenstein.

Was I at that dinner? Just
tell me. Was I at the dinner?

You were wandering around.

Was I at that dinner?!

You were wandering around.

Was I at that dinner?

You were in the... you were in the building.

I was in the building?

So you know (...) well I was
at that dinner, and you swore to me

that I would have a fair hearing
at that dinner. Did you not?

Did you not?

Well, tell me I was
at least at the dinner.

A-allow me that much.

Give me that much at least!

Yes, you were.

Yeah, thanks for not

calling me a liar, you son of a (...).

Good evening, everyone. I'm Paige Novodor.

What should have been
a routine licensing hearing

turned into bedlam yesterday

when the flamboyant
Tangiers casino executive

Sam "Ace" Rothstein accused the
state's top gaming officials

of corruption and hypocrisy.

...fair hearing when you were
getting comped at my hotel

and you were asking me
for copies of your bills

so you could put them on
your expense account?

In a wild and unprecedented outburst

that followed his gaming license denial,

Rothstein followed
several stunned commissioners

into the hallway where

until his own lawyers
and friends urged him to leave.

ACE: You have a past. I have a past.

And my past is no worse than yours.

But you guys think you have the right

to pass judgment on me.

PAIGE: Long suspected
of running the Tangiers

without a gaming license,

yesterday's hearing was
to determine whether someone

with Rothstein's
checkered personal history

was qualified to officially
hold the top gaming post.

ACE (echoes): (...)in' hypocrites!

What the hell's he gonna do now?

I don't know. (sighs)

What's he doin'?

He knows all those guys he
yelled at are friends of ours.

What's the matter with him,
making all this mess?

Maybe he could run things
with another job title.

Won't be the best, but, uh,
what are we gonna do?

REMO: However he runs things,
it's gotta be quiet.

Let him hide upstairs in the office.

Say he's a janitor. I don't give a (...).

But, please, whatever job he takes,

make sure it's something quiet.

WOMAN: Ladies and gentlemen,

the Tangiers Hotel proudly presents

the all-new Sam Rothstein show, Aces High.

♪♪ (disco)

Tonight, taped live
from the all-new sports book,

we present the premiere showing
of Aces High...

with the Sasha Semenoff Orchestra...

...and the Sam Rothstein dancers!

Mr. Rothstein

is a professional gambler and
the best football handicapper

in America,

a man who will take you
inside the real Las Vegas

as no one has ever done before.

And now, ladies and gentlemen,

the new entertainment director
of the Tangiers Hotel Casino,

Mr. Sam Rothstein!

(applause)

Welcome to the Sam Rothstein Show.

We're very happy
to have you here this evening.

The young lady to my left is Trudy,

who is a lead new dancer
on our fabulous show from Paris.

(applause)

Our first guest this evening...

...is Frankie Avalon.

Keep an eye on him.

AVALON: Well, I've got a large family.

ACE: How many kids do you have?

Uh, I'm very proud to say
that we have eight children.

(applause)

No, no, no, no. Please, please,
please, please. No, please.

That's amazing.

There's nothing to it. (chuckles)

It was my pleasure.

(audience laughter)

GREEN: Ace, don't do it.

♪♪ ("Flight of the Bumblebee")

Oh, no, no. Oh, no.

Oh, Jesus.

He's juggling.

ACE: Let's not take
County Commissioner Pat Webb

too seriously.

I recently challenged him
to a debate on this program,

and he declined.

What are you worried about, Pat?

You don't have to send me any questions.

You can ask me anything you want.

STONE: What the hell is he doing
on television anyway?

He's on all night screaming about
how he's gonna take his (...) lawsuit

all the way to the Supreme Court.

He really must be crazy.

He's gonna go to Washington with this?

(chuckles) He's out of his (...)in' mind.

ACE: It's a pity

in this state that we have such hypocrisy.

Some people can do whatever they want.

Other people have to pay through the nose.

But such is life.

Andy... go see him.

Tell him maybe it's time he should quit.

ACE: First of all, what they did
was totally unconstitutional.

We're already on the list to be heard

before the Supreme Court of the
United States later this year.

These guys back home don't give
a (...) about the Supreme Court
or any of this bull(...).

They want things to quiet down.
They want you to walk away.

Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious.

How can I walk away? Don't
you see what's going on here?

Don't you see what's at stake?

The old man said

maybe your friend should give in.

And when the old man says "maybe,"

that's like a papal bull.

Not only should you quit, you should run.

Know what my problem is?

Every time they mention
my name in the papers,

these (...)ers, they mention Nicky too.

How the (...) does that help?

I mean, the heat he
brought down is murder.

We had a police department
who was cooperative.

He's pissed them off so much now

that nobody can make a move anymore.

I mean, what do you do about that?

What do you propose?

I don't know. He doesn't listen to me.

Maybe he should... get lost for a while,

take a vacation. Would that be so bad?

They ain't sending Nicky nowhere.

Look, if he took a break,
it would just give everybody

some time to maneuver.
That's all I'm saying.

That's all that I'm saying.

I would forget about the maneuver.

I would just get out.

(sighs)

I can't do that.

ACE: Of course,
as soon as Andy got back home,

Nicky heard about our talk in the car.

Next morning, bright and early,
I get the call.

1:00?

Great.

Good. You know, I've got to do
some shopping afterwards.

You want to go?

But just getting a call
from Nicky wasn't easy anymore.

Even the codes didn't work.
So we figured out another act.

You see, if a phone's tapped,
the feds can only listen in

on the stuff involving crimes,
so on routine calls,

they have to click off
after a few minutes.

GINGER: Yeah, I got a sprained
(...)in' elbow.

Yeah?

Meet me at 3:00.

At Caesar's?

A hundred yards further down the road.

Why?

Don't ask questions. Just be there.

Suzy Creamcheese has the exact

same outfit.

GINGER: (chuckles) I saw something.

Something very... cute.

AGENT: Okay. Uh, he's out.

It's the ant, uh, Brown Unit,

and he's with the bogey.

I think it's Frank.

Nicky started out before me

because it wasn't that easy
for him to get around anymore.

AGENT: Okay, it pulled out pretty fast.
He's headed upstream.

Nicky couldn't even go for a ride

without changing cars at least six times

before they could shake all his tails.

And because of all the planes,

he had to use underground garages.

Meeting in the middle of the
desert always made me nervous.

It's a scary place.

I knew about the holes
in the desert, of course,

and everywhere I looked
there could have been a hole.

Normally, my prospects
of comin' back alive

from a meeting with Nicky
were 99 out of 100.

But this time, when I heard him say

"a couple of hundred yards down the road,"

I gave myself 50-50.

Where the (...) you get off
talkin' to people about me

behind my back, goin' over my head?

What people? What people?

What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?

I don't even know what
you're talking about, Nick.

No?

You said I'm bringing heat on you?

I got to listen to people
because of your (...)in' (...)?

You're orderin' me out?

You better get your own
(...)in' army, pal.

I didn't do anything.

I mean, I didn't order you or anybody.

I only told Andy Stone that
you had a lot of heat on you

and that was a problem.

You want me to get out
of my own (...)in' town?!

Yeah. I said l-l-let the
bull(...) blow over for a while

You wanted to go on TV!

Yeah, I did want

to go on TV. That way I have

They know they can't (...) around

I was an unknown. That's right. Yeah.

You're makin' a big (...)in'
spectacle of yourself.

Me? I wouldn't even be in this
situation if it wasn't for you.

You brought down so much
(...)in' heat on me.

I mean, every time I meet somebody,

the big question is do I know you.

Oh, sure, now you want to blame
your (...)in' license on me,

is that it?

No-- Nicky, when you asked me
if you could come out here,
what did I tell you?

I mean, you asked me and I knew you
were gonna come out no matter what I said.

But what did I tell you?
Do you remember what I told you?

B-back... back up a (...)in'

I asked you?

I've got a marker comin'.

Deal.

MAN: I know, but everything's changed now.

You're talking about a divorce.

You're even asking for alimony payments

Yes.

and-and child support and-and now custody.

I just want what
any divorced woman would get.

I mean, she's only sober
about two hours a day.

It's usually from 11:00 in the morning to
1:00 in the afternoon.

And if I gave her her money and her jewels,

now, you know what she's gonna do.

She's gonna piss it all
away in about a year,

and then where will she be?
Where would you be then?

Coming right back to me. Right back to me.

Or finding some other excuse
to come... (stammers)

(sighs)

We had a deal.

Remember that?

He said,

if it didn't work out between us,

that I could get my things
and I could leave.

Look in my eyes.

Look-look in my eyes.

You know me.

Do you see anything in these
eyes that makes you think

I would ever let someone in your condition

take my child away from me?

Do you?

You know that won't happen.

ACE: And after all this time

and as hard as I tried,

as much as I wanted,

I could never reach her.

I could never make her love me.

I always felt she should
have gone for all that money,

being somebody for the first time in a life

a home, a kid.

That's not what happened.

It just didn't work out that way.

Everything all right?

I mean, what could we do? After a while,

we just take breathers from each other.

You know, little separations.

At that time, I remember Ginger took Amy

and went to Beverly Hills.

She was gonna spend
the week or so shopping.

WOMAN: Yes, Mr. Rothstein?

Operator, the Beverly Hotel
in Beverly Hills, please.

ACE: Mrs. Sam Rothstein, please.

Uh, my wife is with...
with an old friend of hers in...

Hello?

LESTER: Hello?

Yeah, is this Lester?

This is Sam Rothstein.

I want to talk to Ginger.

She's not here, Sam.

Lester,

listen to me very carefully.
I want to talk to Ginger.

I want my kid back.

I want her put on a plane immediately.

I know she's there.
Don't (...) around with me.

I'm not-- Uh, Sam, I wouldn't...

wouldn't do it. Yeah, no, I-I...

You shouldn't do this.

Mm-hmm. 1862. Okay, good.
I'll call you right...

Right away.

I'll call you right back.

Right back.

You got it.

All right. I just bought us a few minutes.

You want to get back at this prick? Hmm?

Okay, you got, what,
$2 million in that box?

(snorts)

Hey, you got a minute? Hey!

He's got $2 million in the box, am I right?

Okay, you let him keep your jewels,

other thing he cares about, huh?

I don't want to go to Europe.

a dream, but now we're going.

Lester, he called you here.

Right.

Here, right?

He just was on the phone.

He called you right here?

I just talked to him.

So he knows where you are.

That means he's sending some guys over here

probably right now.

Ginger, it means he's sitting
by the phone, like a dumbbell,

waiting for me to call him back.

Yeah, he's sitting by the phone
like a dumbbell just

waiting for you to call him
back, that's what he's...

What do you think we're gonna do?!

He's probably got guys
outside the (...)in' house!

It's this (...)in' bull(...) of yours.

This is bull(...).

What, do you want to (...)in'

Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!

(mockingly): "Go, go!"

Ginger, just relax. Nobody's
killing anybody, you hear?

GINGER: I think he's gonna kill me.
I really do.

I think he's gonna kill me.

Just relax. Call me back here

in exactly an hour on this
phone. I'll see what I can do.

Okay. So I'm gonna call you back in an hour

at this number, and you're
gonna be there, right?

I'll be here.

And listen, don't do
anything else crazy, okay?

You all right? Okay.

Bye.

Knock it off. Would you two
knock it off? Get in the car.

She started it.

She started the whole thing.
I'm just standing here.

You're not gonna drive. Don't
even think you're gonna drive.

No, I'm gonna do it.

No, I'm not gonna drive

Hi, Sam.

So what'd you do with it?

With what?

With...

With the money.

I needed some clothes.

$25,000 for clothes?

He wanted a watch too.

$25,000 for clothes and a watch.

Mm-hmm.

Mm-hmm.

MAN: Mr. R., good evening. Signora.

Geno.

This way.

ACE: The good part was I had Amy back.

So we went home,
had the housekeeper stay over,

put the kid to bed,

I calmed myself down,
and we went to dinner.

I tried to keep things nice
and civil, you know, but, hey,

$25,000 for three suits?

That doesn't make much sense.

First of all, he's not gonna
wear thousand-dollar suits.

But let's say he did, which he won't,

how are you gonna get fitted
for 25 suits in three days?

I mean, how could you get fitted that fast?

I can't get fitted that fast,
and I pay twice as much.

I bought him a watch too.

Yeah.

Yeah.

But even if you bought him
a watch, a really nice watch,

one that he thought was nice--

he doesn't know what
the (...) a good watch is--

say you go 5, 10, 12 grand.

Yeah.

At the most, which is impossible for him.

Plus, at the most, three suits,
a thousand apiece.

That still leaves, what,

around $10,000?

Would you knock it off, Sam?

I'm just trying to figure it out.

There's nothing to figure out.

I'm home.

We're working it out.

Yeah, but I've been told before
"We're working it out."

You think that you're home,

after what you just
put me through with Amy,

is a favor to me?

So, counting the watch,
let's say another $4,000

for expenses over the weekend...

...of which you must have had a good time.

I know he did. That's for sure.

of my (...)in' head

with you, you (...)in' (...)!

How could I love you?!
How could I love you?

Treat me like I'm your (...)ing dog!

You're lower than a dog!

GINGER: (...) you!

Here. Here.

Is this enough money? Huh? Will
it last you two (...)in' days?!

Take it, you greedy (...)!
Take the (...)in' money!

I'm going to the bank

and I'm getting my jewelry too!

Good. It opens at 9:00 a.m. Be there!

And don't you send your
guys down there to stop me!

I mean it!

I guarantee you I will not stop you from...

Stop! You're not getting rid
of me with one (...)ing suitcase!

Come back tomorrow.

You'll get the rest. Just get out of here.

Fine. (sniffles)

I'm taking Amy.

You're not taking Amy.

I am. I'm waking her up right now.

You're stoned.

You're a junkie. Get out of here.

I am not!

She's my daughter too! God(...) you!

Get out of here! Send my lawyers
a letter, god-(...)in'-(...) you!

You're not getting away with this!

You're not gonna (...) me out of my end!

(...)er!

(engine revs)

(tires screech)

(vehicle approaching)

(car door closes)

(door opens, closes)

ACE: The funny thing was, after all that,

I didn't want her to go.

She was the mother of my kid. I loved her.

And later, I realized I didn't
want to give her the money

because if I did...

I knew I'd never see her again.

Oh! Have a good day at school. Okay?

Okay.

Okay, angel.

(clears throat)

From now on I have to know where
you and Amy are at all times.

Now, here's a beeper.

I want you to keep it on you--

it's very light--

so I can call you whenever I have to.

Okay?

NICKY: Well, what are you
supposed to do? I mean,
what do you want to do?

You want to stay the way you are?

You want to stay like this?
You can't do that.

I mean, listen, two people don't get along,

at some point you gotta call it...

I mean, it's none of my business,

but I think that's what you got to do--

you got to take it somewhere.

No, you're right. I know.

It's... I was just...

What?

What?

Nothing.

What were you gonna say? Go ahead.

I don't... (sighs)

Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.

Yeah?

Yeah.

Well, I was thinking maybe
you knew somebody at the bank

who could help me get my jewelry out.

There's a lot of money in there.

A lot of money in there, and I'd be willing

to take care of anybody who'd help me out.

Let me think about that.

Okay.

See who I got in there.

Okay.

I got to get somebody I can trust,

you know?

Yeah. 'Cause you know

he's never gonna give me my jewelry.

Oh.

He holds that key so tight

he's probably got it stuck up his (...).

(both laugh)

You're right. That's Sammy.

And he's probably got it there too.

(chuckles)

He's so (...)in' lucky.

I could have buried him.

I could have gone to Europe
and taken the baby...

and then he'd have tracked me
down and he'd have killed me.

No, he wouldn't.

I would've.

And he'd have been right too.
I mean, seriously.

Oh, come on.

Well, that's one thing you don't do.

You don't take a guy's kid
and then take off.

I didn't.

(laughs) I didn't.

I mean, I did, but then I did
exactly what you told me to do

and I came right back.

You did.

You're right. You did.
I like that. I like that.

Exactly what you said.

That's what I like about you.
You did the right thing.

I did what you told me to.

Yes, you did.

'Cause you always tell me
the right thing to do.

Boy, he really (...)ed himself up
out here, didn't he?

Sure did.

Everything went to his head.

(sighs)

BOTH: Changed.

He did. He ain't the same person, right?

No, he's not.

He really thinks who the (...)
he is, I'll tell you that.

Exactly.

He hates me.

(crying): He hates my (...)ing guts.

Come on, come on. You're a toughie.

You can take this.

Okay?

I'm not as tough as you think I am.

Yes, you are.

I'm not, and he scares the (...) out of me.

I never know what he's gonna do.

Come on.

Don't be scared.

I need some help. I do.

I need some help.

You gotta help me.

I need a new sponsor, Nicky.

I do. I need a new sponsor.

Is that what you want? Yeah.

A sponsor? Yeah.

Oh. Okay.

Don't worry about it.

Nobody will (...) with you any more.

Take care of me? I'll take care of you.
Yes, I will.

That's what you want, isn't it? Huh?

Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

That's what you want? Uh-huh.

Huh? Mm-hmm.

Hello.

Hi.

You didn't answer your beeper.

I threw it away.

You threw it away?

Look,

I tried to do this thing.
I know that you want me to.

But it's just, you know,
I'm driving down the freeway,

and the (...)in' thing's
beep-beep-beep-beep-beep!

You know, I'm in a restaurant.
It's-it's embarrassing.

I don't want to do it anymore.

Where's Amy?

I put her to bed.

Oh.

I got you cigarettes.

Oscar wants you to call him.

So who'd you go to lunch with?

With Jennifer.

Where'd you go?

To the Riviera.

What'd you have?

I had a salad.

What did Jennifer have?

She had the same.

Okay.

I want you to call Jennifer
and I want you to tell her

to tell you what she had for lunch,

and I'm gonna listen in on the other line.

Why do you want to do that?

You know why

I want to do it.

Just do it.

Fine.

I just need to get
the ball for my... thing.

(dialing)

(line ringing)

The line's busy. There's nobody there.

Hello?

Hello, Jennifer.

It's Sam.

All right.

I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.

(softly): Okay.

Who were you with?

(sotto voce): I was with somebody.

I know you were with somebody. Who was it?

I just hope it's not someone
who I think it might be.

(sighs): I just hope it's not them.

ACE: I knew she (...)ed around,

and she did what she did
and I did what I had to do,

but... (sighing)

...Jesus, Nicky was the worst
thing she could've done.

What if he won't stop?

I mean, it could get us both killed.

I can back him off.

(sighs)

She was very convincing

when she wanted to be.

And this-- this is how she backed him off.

(panting)

Hey, Ginger.

Don't forget-- if you're challenged,

you know, if he asks anything,
deny everything.

You understand? I don't want
him bringing beefs back home,

'cause that could really
cause a serious problem.

Got to be careful. He's not dumb, you know?

You hear what I'm saying, right?

I know. You don't have to tell me that.

(chuckles): What do you think, I'm stupid?

Do I think you're stupid? No.

I think you're beautiful.

But I gotta go.

By this time, Nicky had things
so (...)ed up on the streets

that every time Marino went back home,

the packages got smaller and smaller.

It got to the point,
when he walked into the place,

he didn't know whether he
was gonna be kissed or killed.

REMO: Frankie, I want to ask you something.

It's private.

But I want you to tell me the truth.

Of course, Remo.

I want you to tell me the truth, mind you.

I always tell you the truth, Remo.

Frankie... the little guy--

he wouldn't be (...)in'
the Jew's wife, would he?

Because if he is...

it's a problem.

FRANK (narrating): What could I say?

I knew if I gave the wrong answer,

I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace--

all of them could've
wound up gettin' killed.

Because there's one thing
about these old-timers--

they don't like any (...)in' around

with the other guys' wives.

It's bad for business.

So I lied,

even though I knew that, by lying to Gaggi,

I could've wound up gettin' killed too.

No.

I ain't seen anything like that.

Are you sure?

I'm positive.

Remo...

things are very (...)ed up
down there, you know?

Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking.

You see, my main concern is Nicky.

Mm-hmm.

I want to know if he's doing all right,

if he's okay.

He's good. He's fine.

I'm asking you,

Frankie, to keep an eye on Nicky.

Do it for me.

No problem.

You see, I wouldn't want
to be jeopardizing anything

for people who are our friends.
You understand?

I understand.

Okay.

Frankie, you're a good boy.

Thanks, Remo.

ACE: By now, Nicky and his crew had already

hit rock bottom. I mean,
Vegas really got to him.

♪ It's just a shot away... ♪

The booze, the coke, the broads.

I mean, he got sloppy.

He just wasn't the same Nicky anymore.

Must've drank too much.

Go (...) yourself.

I heard one night he had
to belt a guy three times

before the guy finally went down.

In the old days, Nicky would've
decked him with one shot.

You add this into the mix...

Maybe just Vegas got to all of us.

And his crew followed him
right over the edge.

They were all tuned up
half the time on coke.

I mean, they started doing stupid things.

The worst was Blue.

Hey, what do you guys want
out of my life, huh?

Police! Stay in the (...)in' car!

Never knew when
to keep his (...)in' mouth shut.

(indistinct shouting)

OFFICER: Drop the gun!

(...) you!

Drop the gun!

The cops shot him. They shot Blue

because they thought his
hero sandwich was a gun.

(guns popping)

You know, they could've
been right, but who knows?

Jesus Christ. What gun?

He's got a (...)in' hero sandwich here.

What do you want? It--
it's pitch black out here.

Pitch black?

It's tinfoil. It looked
like a (...)in' gun!

You (...)in' moron!
I'll be fillin' out paperwork

for the next two months because
of you and this piece of (...).

What are we gonna do? I'm sorry.

You (...)in' (...)-off!

And to make matters worse, to get even,

Nicky's crew got stoned one night,

and they started shooting up
the cops' houses.

I mean, it got to the point

where they couldn't even
talk in the Gold Rush anymore

because the Feds put a wire in the wall.

And even when they talked outside,

they had to cover their mouths because...

(...), he's covering up again.

...the Feds brought in lip-readers.

Nicky found out about it from
a teller who owed him money.

FRANK: He asked me again about
you and the Jew's wife.

Walk, walk, walk.

What'd you say?

He asked me again about
you and the Jew's wife.

Yeah? What'd you tell him?

I told him I didn't know nothin'.

The Jigs and, uh, Tony Gorilla

said if you did anything, you (...)ed up.

You think he's going home
making a beef behind my back?

Nah. You would've heard something.

Yeah, what's to stop him?

I know. I know.

I don't trust him anymore,

but they'd never okay anything, you know?

Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.

Oh, well, I'm sure they're askin'.

They earn with the prick.

I got a funny feeling he's gonna

start a (...)in' war or something.

I'm not sure yet, you know,
but I-- you know--

but you know what I want you to do?

Who's this guy? Who's this guy?

That ain't nobody.

You know what I want you to do?

Get a couple of guys to dig
a hole in the desert.

Then let them show you where it's at.

Angelo and Buster.

Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.

They'll do it.

And when I'm ready, I'll say the words--

go see the Jew.

Yeah.

And you make it disappear.
You know what I mean?

Yeah, just let me know.
But you gotta be ready.

You know what I'm talkin' about?

Did I say to do anything yet?
I said I'm not sure.

I'll let you know.
I'm gonna think about it.

Where are these pricks at?

Dominick said they're in the motel?

Yeah, either that or in
the (...)in' bank. I don't know.

Roll over the Jew.

It's me.

Nick?

Yeah. What are you doing? You okay?

No, I'm not okay.

How'd you know I was here?

Uh, you know, I just wanted
to talk to you a minute.

Well, Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up

and she locked her in a room.

I gotta find her. I don't know
where the hell she is.

Well, listen, Ginger's over here
at the Leaning Tower with me.

She's there with you? She's there with you?

Yeah, she's here.

Shh. She didn't know who to turn to.

She didn't know where
